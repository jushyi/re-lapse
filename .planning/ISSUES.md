## Closed Enhancements

### ISS-004: Comments sheet closes when navigating to profile

- **Discovered:** Phase 15.3 Plan 02 verification (2026-02-02)
- **Closed:** 2026-02-06
- **Type:** Bug
- **Resolution:** Fixed in Phase 33-01 by converting CommentsBottomSheet from Modal to Animated.View. The Modal component was getting dismissed by React Native when OtherUserProfile (fullScreenModal) pushed on top. Animated.View with pointerEvents and backdropOpacity stays in render tree and survives navigation.
- **Files modified:** `src/components/comments/CommentsBottomSheet.js`, `src/styles/CommentsBottomSheet.styles.js`

### ISS-005: Swipe up on photo to open comments

- **Discovered:** Phase 15.3 Plan 02 verification (2026-02-02)
- **Closed:** 2026-02-06
- **Type:** Enhancement
- **Resolution:** Fixed in Phase 33-01 by adding upward swipe detection to usePhotoDetailModal hook. PanResponder now detects swipe-up gestures (dy < -50 or vy < -0.5) and triggers onSwipeUp callback. PhotoDetailScreen connects this to setShowComments(true).
- **Files modified:** `src/hooks/usePhotoDetailModal.js`, `src/screens/PhotoDetailScreen.js`

### ISS-001: Optimize photo display for full viewing in albums

- **Discovered:** Phase 8 Task 1 (2026-01-29)
- **Closed:** 2026-02-06
- **Type:** UX
- **Resolution:** Fixed in Phase 32-01 by changing `contentFit` from `cover` to `contain` in AlbumPhotoViewer. Photos now display in full without cropping, with letterboxing if aspect ratio differs from screen. Feed/stories views kept `cover` mode per user preference for immersive full-screen experience.
- **Files modified:** `src/components/AlbumPhotoViewer.js`

### ISS-010: Duplicate day headers in monthly albums when journaling old photos

- **Discovered:** Phase 18 testing (2026-02-04)
- **Closed:** 2026-02-04
- **Type:** Bug
- **Resolution:** Fixed by adding `getMonthFromTimestamp()` helper and updating `triagePhoto()` to recalculate `month` from `capturedAt` when journaling. Now photos are assigned to the correct month based on when they were taken, not when they were triaged.
- **Files modified:** `src/services/firebase/photoService.js`
- **Note:** Existing photos with incorrect `month` fields are not auto-migrated. New triage actions will use correct month. Manual data fix may be needed for already-affected photos.

### ISS-002: Comment avatar profile navigation not working

- **Discovered:** Phase 15.2 FIX2 verification (2026-02-02)
- **Closed:** 2026-02-03
- **Type:** Bug
- **Resolution:** Fixed in Phase 15.3-02 by wiring up `handleCommentAvatarPress` in PhotoDetailScreen to call `contextAvatarPress` which routes through FeedScreen's callback to navigate to OtherUserProfile. Navigation now works correctly.
- **Related:** ISS-004 tracks the follow-up issue where comments close during this navigation

### ISS-003: Modal stacking architecture - underlying modals hidden on profile navigation

- **Discovered:** Phase 15.2 FIX2 verification (2026-02-02)
- **Closed:** 2026-02-03
- **Type:** Architecture
- **Resolution:** Fixed in Phase 15.3-02 by converting PhotoDetailModal from Modal component to navigation screen using `transparentModal` presentation. Previous screens now stay visible underneath when navigating to profiles.

### ISS-006: Own story ring indicator doesn't update after viewing

- **Discovered:** Phase 15.4 FIX verification (2026-02-03)
- **Closed:** 2026-02-03
- **Type:** Bug
- **Resolution:** Fixed in Phase 15.4-02-FIX by using refs for close handlers. Root cause was stale closure - the `setCallbacks` useEffect captured an old version of `handleCloseMyStories` that had null `myStories` state. Fix: Added `handleCloseMyStoriesRef` and `handleCloseStoriesRef` refs, update them on each render, and call via refs in the callback.

### ISS-007: Own story doesn't resume at correct position

- **Discovered:** Phase 15.4 FIX verification (2026-02-03)
- **Closed:** 2026-02-03
- **Type:** Bug
- **Resolution:** Fixed in Phase 15.4-02-FIX (same fix as ISS-006). The stale closure meant `markPhotosAsViewed` was never called with valid photo IDs, so `getFirstUnviewedIndex` didn't see any photos as viewed. With the ref-based handlers, photos are now correctly marked as viewed.

### ISS-008: Reactions not sorting by count (highest left)

- **Discovered:** Phase 15.4 FIX verification (2026-02-03)
- **Closed:** 2026-02-03
- **Reopened as:** ISS-009
- **Type:** Bug (Regression)
- **Resolution:** Attempted fix in Phase 15.4-02-FIX by resetting `frozenOrder` state when photo changes. However, verification showed reactions still not sorting correctly. Issue reopened as ISS-009 for further investigation.

### ISS-009: Reactions still not sorting by count (highest left)

- **Discovered:** Phase 15.4-02-FIX verification (2026-02-03)
- **Closed:** 2026-02-03
- **Type:** Bug
- **Resolution:** Fixed in Phase 15.4-03-FIX with two root causes identified:
  1. **Stale data in useMemo**: The `groupedReactions` useMemo depended on a destructured `reactions` variable, but React's dependency comparison wasn't detecting changes when photos loaded from Firestore. Fix: Read directly from `currentPhoto?.reactions` inside the memo and depend on `currentPhoto`.
  2. **Custom emojis not sorted**: The `orderedEmojis` logic only sorted curated emojis by count - custom emojis (added via emoji picker) were prepended without sorting. Fix: Changed to sort ALL emojis (custom + curated) together by total count.
- **Files modified:** `src/hooks/usePhotoDetailModal.js`
- **Pattern:** Always read from source object inside useMemo/useCallback rather than relying on destructured variables for React dependency comparison.

### ISS-011: Custom profile photo crop UI with circular preview

- **Discovered:** Phase 22 Task 2 (2026-02-05)
- **Closed:** 2026-02-06
- **Type:** Enhancement
- **Resolution:** Fixed in Phase 32-02 by creating custom ProfilePhotoCropScreen with:
  1. SVG-based circular mask overlay (transparent circle, 70% dimmed outside)
  2. Pinch-to-zoom and pan gestures using react-native-gesture-handler + react-native-reanimated
  3. expo-image-manipulator for cropping to square 1:1 output
  4. Direct gesture response (no bouncy animations)
  5. Zoom limits: minimum fills circle, maximum 4x
- **Files created:** `src/screens/ProfilePhotoCropScreen.js`
- **Files modified:** `src/screens/EditProfileScreen.js`, `src/screens/ProfileSetupScreen.js`, `src/navigation/AppNavigator.js`
- **Note:** "Edit existing photo" capability (re-cropping uploaded photo) not included in this fix - would require downloading current photo from Firebase Storage first.
