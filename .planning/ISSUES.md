Enhancements discovered during execution. Not critical - address in future phases.

## Open Enhancements

### ISS-001: Optimize photo capture for full-screen display

- **Discovered:** Phase 8 Task 1 (2026-01-29)
- **Type:** UX
- **Description:** Photos taken in the app should be captured at an aspect ratio that fills the full screen when viewed in AlbumPhotoViewer (and other full-screen viewers). Currently photos may have different aspect ratios causing black bars or cropping when displayed full-screen.
- **Impact:** Low (works correctly with cover/contain modes, this would enhance visual experience)
- **Effort:** Medium (requires camera capture settings adjustment and potentially migration for existing photos)
- **Suggested phase:** Future
