# Lapse Clone - Camera/Darkroom UX Refactor

## What This Is

A comprehensive UI/UX refactor of the Camera and Darkroom experience in the Lapse social media clone app. The app features instant photo capture with background uploads, a redesigned darkroom with fluid triage animations, batched undo capability, and a polished notification system - all with phone-only authentication and native iOS gestures throughout.

## Core Value

Instant, delightful photo capture and reveal experience - photos capture without blocking, triage flows like flipping through a deck of cards, and every interaction feels responsive with haptic feedback.

## Current State (v0.6 Shipped)

**Shipped:** 2026-01-25
**Execution time:** 18.9 hours total (v0.1: 4.3h + v0.2: 2.1h + v0.3: 0.7h + v0.4: 1.4h + v0.5: 5.8h + v0.6: 4.6h)
**Phases:** 55 phases, 100 plans across six milestones

The Code Quality, Security & Documentation milestone is complete:

- ESLint 9 + Prettier + Husky pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Security hardening (API key remediation, Firestore rules audit, Zod validation)
- SecureStore for iOS Keychain encrypted storage
- Privacy features (Settings, legal screens, account deletion)
- Jest test suite (25 unit tests + 6 integration tests)
- Component refactoring (4 major components extracted into hooks)
- Project documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, ANIMATIONS, JSDoc)

### Active

(None - v0.6 complete, ready for TestFlight submission)

### Out of Scope

- No changes to photo capture logic (compression, upload, storage) - Only UI/UX updates
- No changes to darkroom reveal timing system (batch scheduling, random intervals) - Backend logic stays the same
- No changes to Feed, Friends, or Profile tabs - Strictly Camera/Darkroom + Auth refactor
- No changes to Firestore schema or photo lifecycle states - Keep existing data structure
- Email/password authentication - Replaced with phone auth in v0.2
- Apple Sign-In - Removed in v0.2 for simpler phone-only flow

## Context

**Codebase State (v0.6):**

- React Native mobile app with Expo managed workflow (SDK ~54.0.30)
- 196 files changed in v0.6 milestone (+38,154 / -7,940 lines)
- Total codebase: ~45,000 lines JavaScript/TypeScript across 80+ source files
- New infrastructure: ESLint, Prettier, Jest, SecureStore, Zod validation
- New features: Settings screen, account deletion, legal screens
- iOS build available via EAS internal distribution

**Tech Stack:**

- Firebase BaaS for backend (Firestore, Storage, Functions)
- React Native Firebase for all Firebase operations (@react-native-firebase/app, auth, firestore, storage)
- React Navigation 7.x for screen navigation (bottom tabs + nested stacks)
- expo-camera for camera access, expo-image-manipulator for compression
- react-native-gesture-handler + react-native-reanimated for gestures and animations
- expo-haptics for tactile feedback
- expo-image for optimized image loading with native caching
- expo-av for audio playback (success sounds)
- expo-linear-gradient for gradient UI elements
- libphonenumber-js for phone validation and formatting
- expo-splash-screen for animated splash
- eas-cli for iOS builds and distribution

**User Feedback:**

- Instant capture feels responsive and professional
- Triage animations are fluid and satisfying
- Undo feature provides confidence during triage
- Notification feed keeps users engaged with reactions

## Constraints

- **Platform**: Standalone iOS build via EAS - Full notification support enabled
- **Backend**: Keep existing Firebase structure - No schema changes to Firestore collections
- **Photo Lifecycle**: Preserve existing states - developing/revealed/triaged status logic unchanged
- **Real-time Sync**: Maintain Firestore listeners - Badge counts and photo updates must remain real-time
- **Navigation**: React Navigation 7.x - Use existing navigation framework and patterns
- **Testing**: Physical iOS device with standalone build for full feature testing

## Key Decisions

| Decision                                        | Rationale                                                                              | Outcome |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| RN Firebase method chaining pattern             | Consistent with RN Firebase SDK conventions, works with native modules                 | ✓ Good  |
| Filter.or for OR queries                        | JS SDK or() unavailable in RN Firebase; Filter.or provides same functionality          | ✓ Good  |
| putFile over uploadBytes                        | RN Firebase putFile accepts local paths directly, eliminating blob conversion overhead | ✓ Good  |
| Delete firestoreService.js                      | Unused legacy functions; all services migrated to dedicated files                      | ✓ Good  |
| Delete firebaseConfig.js                        | JS SDK init no longer needed; RN Firebase auto-inits from google-services              | ✓ Good  |
| Remove Darkroom tab from nav                    | User wants unified camera experience, darkroom accessed via button                     | ✓ Good  |
| iOS Mail-style swipe actions                    | Native gesture pattern users already know, feels polished                              | ✓ Good  |
| Press-and-hold to reveal                        | Adds ceremony and engagement to photo reveal moment                                    | ✓ Good  |
| Animated celebration success page               | Positive reinforcement after completing triage                                         | ✓ Good  |
| Darkroom button left of capture                 | Positions secondary action away from primary (capture)                                 | ✓ Good  |
| Disable darkroom button when not ready          | Clear visual affordance, prevents confusion                                            | ✓ Good  |
| Keep existing photoService/darkroomService      | No need to refactor backend logic, only UI layer changes                               | ✓ Good  |
| Absolute positioning for CameraView overlays    | CameraView doesn't support children well in some expo-camera versions                  | ✓ Good  |
| TAB_BAR_HEIGHT = 65px                           | Accounts for bottom tab navigator height including safe area                           | ✓ Good  |

| React Native Firebase for phone auth            | JS SDK cannot support silent APNs verification; native SDK enables seamless phone auth | ✓ Good  |
| libphonenumber-js for validation                | Lightweight validation, can enhance UI later                                           | ✓ Good  |
| Manual country picker (15 countries)            | Simpler implementation, covers common cases                                            | ✓ Good  |
| Auto-submit on 6 digits                         | Better UX - no need to press verify button                                             | ✓ Good  |
| reCAPTCHA fallback over APNs                    | Simpler than configuring APNs certificates; works without full push notification setup | ✓ Good  |
| RN Firebase Firestore for phone auth users      | JS SDK Firestore doesn't share auth state with RN Firebase Auth                        | ✓ Good  |
| Full deletion of authService.js                 | All email auth removed; cleaner than keeping utility functions                         | ✓ Good  |
