## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions documented in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table with outcomes.

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 17-02 | Gesture.Pan() API for swipe gestures | useAnimatedGestureHandler deprecated in Reanimated v4 |
| 17-02 | View-based icons for overlays | Cleaner look than emoji, consistent styling |
| 17-FIX | Removed down-swipe delete gesture | Prevents accidental deletions during horizontal swipes |
| 17-FIX | Fixed arc path formula (y = 0.4 * \|x\|) | Predictable card motion regardless of finger movement |
| 17-FIX-2 | Stack offset -20/-40px for visible peek | Cards visibly peek from top at rest |
| 17-FIX-2 | Animation duration 400ms | Balances visibility with responsiveness |
| 17-FIX-3 | Dark overlay for stack blur effect | Animatable alternative to blurRadius |
| 17-FIX-4 | Cascading prop for parallel animation sync | Stack cards animate during exit, not after |
| 17-FIX-6 | BUTTON_EXIT_DURATION 1200ms (3x swipe) | Button taps feel instant without lead-in time |
| 17.1-01 | Inline success state instead of separate screen | Eliminates jarring navigation jump |
| 17.1-01 | Sparkles instead of confetti | Subtle celebration effect per user feedback |
| 17.1-01-FIX | pendingSuccess state for transition timing | Prevents empty state flash before success |
| 17.1-01-FIX | Header-only swipe gesture | Avoids conflicts with photo triage gestures |
| 17.1-01-FIX-2 | Screen-level translateY animation | Header swipe moves entire screen together |
| 17.1-01-FIX-3 | Transparent GestureHandlerRootView | Prevents double-background during swipe |
| 17.1-01-FIX-3 | goBack() for Done button | Consistent slide-down close animation |
| 17.1-01-FIX-4 | Remove header swipe feature | Feature unnecessary, chevron/Done buttons sufficient |
| 17.1-01-FIX-4 | isButtonDelete flag for overlay | Delete overlay only shows during button-triggered delete |
| 18-01 | In-memory pendingReactions for debouncing | Simple, effective for single-instance Cloud Functions |
| 18-01 | Sliding window debounce (10s) | Each new reaction resets timer for better batching |
| 18-02 | Red dot indicator vs count badge | Simpler, Instagram-style notification indicator |
| 18.1-02 | Done button only on success screen | Cleaner triage UX without header clutter |
| 18.1-02 | Ionicons for Undo button | Native look, no count display |
| 18.1-FIX-2 | Hidden state tracking vs array mutation | Prevents React re-renders that cause black flash |
| 18.1-FIX-2 | cascadeHandledTransition flag | Prevents double-animation during cascade |
| 18.1-FIX-3 | expo-image instead of RN Image | Native caching + 200ms transition eliminates black flash |
| 18.1-FIX-3 | Remove blur overlay workaround | expo-image transition prop handles this automatically |
| 18.1-FIX-4 | Smoother spring config (damping: 18, stiffness: 100) | Gradual settling instead of snappy bounce |
| 18.1-FIX-4 | 100ms delay for front card transition | Exiting card clears space before next card settles |
| 18.1-FIX-4 | 300ms fade-in for new stack cards | New back cards appear smoothly instead of abruptly |
| 18.1-FIX-5 | Single stackIndex useEffect for animation | Eliminates race condition between cascading and stackIndex useEffects |
| 18.1-FIX-5 | Timing over spring animation (350ms) | Predictable cascade motion without mid-flight interruptions |
| 18.1-FIX-6 | isTransitioningToFront flag for cardStyle | Keeps using stackOffsetAnim during transition before switching to gesture transforms |
| 18.2-01 | Fire-and-forget playSuccessSound() | No await to avoid blocking UI animation |
| 18.2-01 | Auto-unload on playback finish | Prevents memory leaks from audio playback |
| 18.3-01 | Callback on cardScale not translateX | translateX was 0→0 (instant), cardScale is 1→0.1 (actual animation) |
| 18.3-01 | actionInProgress override in cardStyle | Ensures delete suction works even during card transition |
| 18.3-01 | Easing.in(cubic) for suction | Accelerating "pulled in" feel instead of decelerating |
| 18.4-01 | Exponential power curve (x^2.5) for arc | Cards start flat, accelerate downward as they exit |
| 18.4-01 | Linear rotation preserved | User preferred original tilt feel over exponential |
| 18.4-01 | EXIT_DURATION 800ms | Slower animation for smooth arc visibility |
