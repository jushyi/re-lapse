### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

| Phase | Decision                                                      | Rationale                                                                                                                |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 42    | Mutual friend computation via Cloud Function                  | Firestore security rules correctly block client-side cross-user friendship queries; admin SDK is the established pattern |
| 44    | All photo notification taps open PhotoDetail directly         | FeedScreen has no handler for photoId route params; openPhotoDetail context is the correct pattern                       |
| 44    | friend_accepted navigates to sender's profile                 | More useful than friends list — user wants to see who accepted                                                           |
| 45    | Main photos owner-only in Storage, friends via Cloud Function | Admin SDK bypasses Storage rules; getSignedPhotoUrl is the correct access path for non-owners                            |
