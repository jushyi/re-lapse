### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

| Phase | Decision                                                  | Rationale                                                             |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 46.1  | OtherUserProfile card instead of fullScreenModal          | fullScreenModal prevents child card screens from pushing on iOS       |
| 47    | Custom code traces, not startScreenTrace()                | startScreenTrace() crashes on iOS                                     |
| 47    | **DEV** guard skips trace creation entirely               | Prevent polluting production metrics with dev data                    |
| 47.1  | Direct set intersection for mutual friend tagging         | Simpler/cheaper than friends-of-friends graph traversal               |
| 47.1  | Inline overlay (not Modal/Portal) for mention suggestions | CommentsBottomSheet uses Animated.View — Modal breaks layering        |
| 48    | Callback pattern for SongSearch navigation                | Preserves source screen local state; matches ProfilePhotoCrop         |
| 48    | Edge masks for directional overflow clipping              | RN lacks overflow-x/y; opaque masks clip H while allowing V           |
| 47.1  | requestAnimationFrame for Text.onPress navigation         | Text.onPress vs TouchableOpacity.onPress differ in Animated.View      |
| 48    | Modal screens skip paddingTop: insets.top                 | presentation: 'modal' already offsets from status bar on iOS          |
| 49    | --legacy-peer-deps for RNTL v13 install                   | react-test-renderer deprecated in React 19, RNTL makes it optional    |
| 48.1  | fullScreenModal for ProfileFromPhotoDetail                | iOS modal stacking: fullScreenModal renders above transparentModal    |
| 48.1  | Accept slide-from-bottom + no gesture dismiss             | Native iOS modal behavior, user confirmed acceptable trade-off        |
| 50    | APP_ENV env var for aps-environment switching             | Dynamic config in app.config.js, production set via eas.json env      |
| 50    | expo export for free PR bundle verification               | No EAS build credits consumed, validates JS bundle compiles           |
| 50    | Developer role (not Admin) for EXPO_TOKEN robot           | Minimum necessary permissions for EAS Build/Submit                    |
| 50.1  | Sequential test runner (&&) not Jest projects             | Two suites have incompatible presets (jest-expo vs node)              |
| 50.1  | Local service mocks, not global for block/album           | Global mocks break those services' own test suites                    |
| 50.1  | Prioritize service tests over integration tests           | Service tests verify core logic; integration test failures deferred   |
| 51    | Bundle ID rebrand: com.spoodsjs.rewind → flick            | Production Firebase setup + App Store release preparation             |
| 51    | EAS env vars for Firebase project switching               | Build profiles set GOOGLE_SERVICES_PLIST path deterministically       |
| 51    | Firebase region us-central1 for production                | Default region, best availability, lowest cost (cannot change)        |
| 51    | supportsTablet: false (iPad disabled)                     | Phone-only by design, avoids iPad review risk and UI complexity       |
| 51-04 | Domain: flickcam.app                                      | Short, memorable, ties to camera concept, .app TLD is professional    |
| 51-04 | Google Workspace instead of email forwarding              | Professional email, Firebase/GCP integration, can send from domain    |
| 51-04 | New iOS OAuth 2.0 Client ID for production                | Phone auth reCAPTCHA needs production project OAuth credentials       |
| 51-05 | Fire-and-forget email for reports                         | Email failure logged but doesn't prevent report submission            |
| 51-05 | Gmail SMTP for Cloud Functions email                      | Simplest approach for single-developer app, uses App Password         |
| 51-09 | App name: Flick - Photo Journal                           | Base name "Flick" taken on App Store, hyphenated version available    |

| 51-09 | Age rating: 12+                                           | User-generated content with infrequent/mild profanity                 |
| 51-09 | Defer screenshot capture until pre-submission             | Allows UI polish before captures; infrastructure ready now            |
| 51-10 | Defer production build/submit to UAT                      | Systematic testing on TestFlight before App Review submission         |
| 52.1  | 30-second batching window for reactions                   | Better aggregation than 10s, balances responsiveness vs efficiency    |
| 52.1  | Firestore-based batching state                            | Persists across stateless Cloud Function instances, prevents dupes    |
| 52.1  | Cloud Tasks for delayed execution                         | Reliable delayed sends in serverless (replaces setTimeout)            |
| 52.1  | User data fetching at send time                           | Respects preference changes during 30-second batch window             |
| 52-03 | Clear expo-image cache on sign out                        | Prevents stale gray photos when user re-authenticates                 |
| 52-03 | perf.dataCollectionEnabled instead of modular function    | setPerformanceCollectionEnabled not exported in RN Firebase v23       |
| 52-04 | Feed must filter both blocker and blocked-by directions   | Previously only filtered users who blocked you, not users you blocked |
| 52-06 | expo-image cacheKey must include coverPhotoId             | Static albumId-only key served stale cached cover after change        |
