# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-26)

**Core value:** All three areas (login/signup flow, profile creation onboarding, profile screen) must be solid and functional — the app's first impression and personal identity depend on it.
**Current focus:** Phase 5 — Profile Screen Layout

## Current Position

Progress: ███████░░░ 70%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 12 (including 1 FIX plan)
- Average duration: 14.2 min
- Total execution time: 170 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total  | Avg/Plan |
| ----- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| 1     | 1     | 2 min  | 2 min    |
| 2     | 1     | 5 min  | 5 min    |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 15 min, 12 min, 45 min, 25 min, 14 min
- Trend: Back to normal pace after Phase 4.1 animation complexity
