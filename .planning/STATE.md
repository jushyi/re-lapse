## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions documented in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table with outcomes.

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 17-02 | Gesture.Pan() API for swipe gestures | useAnimatedGestureHandler deprecated in Reanimated v4 |
| 17-02 | View-based icons for overlays | Cleaner look than emoji, consistent styling |
| 17-FIX | Removed down-swipe delete gesture | Prevents accidental deletions during horizontal swipes |
| 17-FIX | Fixed arc path formula (y = 0.4 * \|x\|) | Predictable card motion regardless of finger movement |
| 17-FIX-2 | Stack offset -20/-40px for visible peek | Cards visibly peek from top at rest |
| 17-FIX-2 | Animation duration 400ms | Balances visibility with responsiveness |
| 17-FIX-3 | Dark overlay for stack blur effect | Animatable alternative to blurRadius |
| 17-FIX-4 | Cascading prop for parallel animation sync | Stack cards animate during exit, not after |
| 17-FIX-6 | BUTTON_EXIT_DURATION 1200ms (3x swipe) | Button taps feel instant without lead-in time |
| 17.1-01 | Inline success state instead of separate screen | Eliminates jarring navigation jump |
| 17.1-01 | Sparkles instead of confetti | Subtle celebration effect per user feedback |
| 17.1-01-FIX | pendingSuccess state for transition timing | Prevents empty state flash before success |
| 17.1-01-FIX | Header-only swipe gesture | Avoids conflicts with photo triage gestures |
| 17.1-01-FIX-2 | Screen-level translateY animation | Header swipe moves entire screen together |
| 17.1-01-FIX-3 | Transparent GestureHandlerRootView | Prevents double-background during swipe |
| 17.1-01-FIX-3 | goBack() for Done button | Consistent slide-down close animation |

### Deferred Issues

- TestFlight submission (requires App Store Connect setup)
- UAT-015 black flash after cascade (deferred to Phase 18.1 batch-based triage)
