### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

| Phase | Decision                                                  | Rationale                                                          |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 46.1  | OtherUserProfile card instead of fullScreenModal          | fullScreenModal prevents child card screens from pushing on iOS    |
| 47    | Custom code traces, not startScreenTrace()                | startScreenTrace() crashes on iOS                                  |
| 47    | **DEV** guard skips trace creation entirely               | Prevent polluting production metrics with dev data                 |
| 47.1  | Direct set intersection for mutual friend tagging         | Simpler/cheaper than friends-of-friends graph traversal            |
| 47.1  | Inline overlay (not Modal/Portal) for mention suggestions | CommentsBottomSheet uses Animated.View — Modal breaks layering     |
| 48    | Callback pattern for SongSearch navigation                | Preserves source screen local state; matches ProfilePhotoCrop      |
| 48    | Edge masks for directional overflow clipping              | RN lacks overflow-x/y; opaque masks clip H while allowing V        |
| 47.1  | requestAnimationFrame for Text.onPress navigation         | Text.onPress vs TouchableOpacity.onPress differ in Animated.View   |
| 48    | Modal screens skip paddingTop: insets.top                 | presentation: 'modal' already offsets from status bar on iOS       |
| 49    | --legacy-peer-deps for RNTL v13 install                   | react-test-renderer deprecated in React 19, RNTL makes it optional |
| 48.1  | fullScreenModal for ProfileFromPhotoDetail                | iOS modal stacking: fullScreenModal renders above transparentModal |
| 48.1  | Accept slide-from-bottom + no gesture dismiss             | Native iOS modal behavior, user confirmed acceptable trade-off     |
| 50    | APP_ENV env var for aps-environment switching             | Dynamic config in app.config.js, production set via eas.json env   |
| 50    | expo export for free PR bundle verification               | No EAS build credits consumed, validates JS bundle compiles        |

### Deferred Issues

~~ISS-012: Friends screen N+1 query pattern causes slow initial load~~ → Fixed in Phase 48-04
~~ISS-014: Profile navigation from PhotoDetail renders behind transparentModal~~ → Fixed in Phase 48.1

**Closed:** ISS-001, ISS-002, ISS-003, ISS-004, ISS-005, ISS-006, ISS-007, ISS-008, ISS-011, ISS-012, ISS-013, ISS-014
