| 7     | Sequential modal flow for song/clip selection         | iOS React Native doesn't support stacked modals; cancel reopens search |
| 7     | 50ms progress update interval for audio               | 20 updates/sec provides smooth playback indicator animation            |

| 7.2   | Screen + Modal overlay pattern                        | iOS doesn't support stacked modals; screen + modal on top works        |
| 7.2   | Cancel always stays on search                         | User can pick different song after previewing current clip             |
| 7.2   | Combined Edit Song menu option                        | Single option opens clip first, cancel goes to search for different    |
| 7.2   | Backdrop fades + content slides animation pattern     | Modal animationType='fade' for backdrop, Animated.spring for content   |
| 7.3   | Keep waveform with drag-to-seek (no range handles)    | User preference for scrubbing through preview; visual feedback helpful |

| 8     | Photos added to beginning of array (newest first)     | Matches expected behavior where new additions appear first             |
| 8     | Auto-update cover when current cover removed          | Prevents broken cover state; falls back to first remaining photo       |

| 8     | Header overlay pattern for photo viewer               | Controls float over photo with semi-transparent background             |
| 8     | Silent cover update (no success dialog)               | Cleaner UX, visual feedback from cover change is sufficient            |
| 8     | useFocusEffect for ProfileScreen album refresh        | Ensures data consistency when returning from nested edits              |
| 8     | AddToAlbumSheet deferred integration                  | Component ready, wiring to photo menus in future phase                 |
