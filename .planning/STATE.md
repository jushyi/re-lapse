# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-26)

**Core value:** All three areas (login/signup flow, profile creation onboarding, profile screen) must be solid and functional — the app's first impression and personal identity depend on it.

| 7     | 5-second minimum clip gap                             | Ensures meaningful clip selection, prevents degenerate ranges          |
| 7     | Sequential modal flow for song/clip selection         | iOS React Native doesn't support stacked modals; cancel reopens search |

| 7     | Linear easing with matching animation duration        | Constant speed movement for audio playback (not spring/ease-in-out)    |
| 7     | Immediate audio cut on stop (no fade out)             | User preference for clean cut over gradual fade                        |
