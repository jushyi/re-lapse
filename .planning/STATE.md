## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions documented in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table with outcomes.

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 17-02 | Gesture.Pan() API for swipe gestures | useAnimatedGestureHandler deprecated in Reanimated v4 |
| 17-02 | View-based icons for overlays | Cleaner look than emoji, consistent styling |
| 17-FIX | Removed down-swipe delete gesture | Prevents accidental deletions during horizontal swipes |
| 17-FIX | Fixed arc path formula (y = 0.4 * \|x\|) | Predictable card motion regardless of finger movement |
| 17-FIX-2 | Stack offset -20/-40px for visible peek | Cards visibly peek from top at rest |
| 17-FIX-2 | Animation duration 400ms | Balances visibility with responsiveness |
