# Roadmap: Auth & Profile Refactor

## Overview

Transform Lapse Clone's authentication experience and profile system from inconsistent placeholders into polished, cohesive screens that match the app's established dark aesthetic. This journey starts with shared auth components, refactors login/signup flows, extends onboarding to capture full profile data, and builds out the profile screen with Selects banner, profile song, and album galleries.

### 🚧 v1.0.0 Release Readiness (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Optimize performance, establish testing infrastructure, and ship the first iOS release with CI/CD pipelines for future updates

**Constraints:**

- iOS only — no Android release in this milestone
- Unlisted release (not searchable, direct link access only)
- Privacy policy and ToS already exist, just need linking
- Apple Developer account partially set up — certificates/profiles still needed
- UAT should cover all 45 previously shipped phases across 8 feature areas

#### Phase 46: Performance Optimization

**Goal**: Firebase queries, UI rendering, and Cloud Functions code-level improvements — composite indexes, pagination, read/write batching, offline caching, FlatList optimization, image caching & lazy loading, native driver animations, React.memo/useMemo re-render reduction, cold start reduction, memory/timeout tuning
**Depends on**: Previous milestone complete
**Research**: Likely (Firebase optimization best practices, composite index configuration, Cloud Functions cold start patterns)
**Research topics**: Firebase composite indexes, query pagination patterns, Cloud Functions cold start reduction, React Native FlatList optimization
**Plans**: 7

Plans:

- [x] 46-01: Feed Query Server-Side Filtering
- [x] 46-02: Firestore Indexes & Read Optimization
- [x] 46-03: Image Loading & Caching
- [x] 46-04: FlatList & React Rendering
- [x] 46-05: React Compiler & Build Config
- [x] 46-06: Cloud Functions Performance
- [x] 46-07: Verification & Documentation

#### Phase 46.1: Other Users Albums View Fix (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Fix bug where viewing other users' albums doesn't work
**Depends on**: Phase 46
**Research**: Unlikely (bug fix — investigating existing code)
**Plans**: 1

Plans:

- [x] 46.1-01: Diagnose and fix other-user album viewing regression

#### Phase 46.2: Album Viewer Nav Bar Optimistic Updates (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Fix album grid full-screen viewer so the bottom nav bar updates optimistically during swipe gestures instead of waiting until the user lands on a photo — currently the nav outline jumps to the new position only after settling, rather than tracking the swipe
**Depends on**: Phase 46
**Research**: Unlikely (bug fix — investigating existing swipe/scroll event handling)
**Plans**: 1

Plans:

- [x] 46.2-01: Add optimistic scroll tracking to album photo viewer

#### Phase 47: Firebase Performance Monitoring

**Goal**: Integrate Firebase Performance Monitoring SDK for ongoing production metrics — network traces, custom traces, screen rendering performance, baseline establishment
**Depends on**: Phase 46
**Research**: Likely (new SDK integration — not currently in codebase)
**Research topics**: Firebase Performance Monitoring SDK setup for React Native/Expo, custom trace API, network trace configuration
**Plans**: 3

Plans:

- [x] 47-01: SDK Installation & Core Utilities
- [x] 47-02: Service File Instrumentation
- [x] 47-03: Screen Traces & Build Verification

#### Phase 47.1: Comment @-Tagging for Mutual Friends (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Add Instagram-style @-mention tagging in comments — users can @ mutual friends (friends of both the commenter and the photo owner) with autocomplete suggestions, linked mentions, and notification integration. Builds on existing comment reply architecture.
**Depends on**: Phase 47
**Research**: Unlikely (extending existing comment system — reviewing current reply/mention patterns)
**Plans**: 2

Plans:

- [x] 47.1-01: Cloud Function Backend (mutual friends + reply @mention notifications)
- [x] 47.1-02: Autocomplete UI + Integration (service, hook, overlay, input, wiring)

#### Phase 48: UI/UX Consistency Audit

**Goal**: Review all screens for visual and interaction consistency — spacing, colors, typography, component patterns, navigation flows, gesture patterns, loading/error states, feedback patterns
**Depends on**: Phase 47
**Research**: Unlikely (internal patterns — reviewing and standardizing existing code)
**Plans**: 7

Plans:

- [x] 48-01: Auth Flow Screens (audit & fix auth/onboarding screens)
- [x] 48-02: Settings & Account Screens (audit & fix settings/account screens)
- [x] 48-03: Social & Friends Screens (audit & fix social screens & components)
- [x] 48-04: FriendsScreen N+1 Query Fix — ISS-012 (batch user fetching, optimize subscriptions)

- [x] 48-07: Profile, Notifications & Shared Components (audit & fix remaining screens & all shared components)

#### Phase 48.1: PhotoDetail Profile Navigation Fix — ISS-014 (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Fix regression where navigating to OtherUserProfile from PhotoDetail renders the profile behind the transparentModal. OtherUserProfile uses `presentation: 'card'` (changed from `fullScreenModal` in Phase 46.1 to allow child card screens on iOS), but PhotoDetail uses `presentation: 'transparentModal'` which renders on a higher native layer. All profile navigation from PhotoDetail/comments is blocked.
**Depends on**: Phase 48
**Research**: Unlikely (bug fix — investigating presentation mode alternatives)
**Plans**: 1

Plans:

- [x] 48.1-01: Fix profile navigation z-order from PhotoDetail/comments views

#### Phase 49: Automated Test Suite

**Goal**: Jest unit tests for business logic + Maestro E2E tests for critical user flows (auth, camera, feed, social) — regression guards for future development
**Depends on**: Phase 48
**Research**: Complete (49-RESEARCH.md — Maestro over Detox, RNTL v13 for hooks, firebase-functions-test for Cloud Functions)
**Plans**: 8

Plans:

- [x] 49-01: Test Infrastructure & Utility Tests
- [x] 49-02: Service Tests — Social Layer (comments, mentions, blocks, reports)
- [x] 49-03: Service Tests — Content & Account Layer (albums, users, accounts, notifications)
- [x] 49-04: Hook Tests (mentions, comments, feed, darkroom)
- [x] 49-05: Cloud Functions Test Infrastructure & Notification Tests
- [x] 49-06: Cloud Functions Trigger & Callable Tests
- [x] 49-07: Maestro E2E Setup & Auth Flow
- [x] 49-08: Maestro E2E Critical Flows & Final Verification

#### Phase 50: CI/CD Pipeline

**Goal**: GitHub Actions for lint/type-check/test on PR, EAS Build on merge to main, EAS Submit on release tag — Apple credentials and EAS tokens in GitHub Secrets
**Depends on**: Phase 49
**Research**: Likely (EAS Build/Submit integration, GitHub Actions workflows)
**Research topics**: EAS Build configuration, GitHub Actions for Expo/EAS, secrets management, pipeline validation
**Plans**: 3

Plans:

- [x] 50-01: Build Config & PR Checks (aps-environment switching, GitHub Actions PR workflow)
- [x] 50-02: EAS Build & Submit Workflows (tag-triggered builds, manual submit with approval gate)
- [ ] 50-03: TBD

- [ ] 51-09: App Store Connect Setup & Screenshots (listing, metadata, privacy, IAP products)
- [ ] 51-10: EAS Build, Submit & Final Verification

#### Phase 52: Systematic UAT

**Goal**: Manual testing checklists across all 8 feature areas (Auth, Profile, Camera/Photos, Feed, Stories, Social, Notifications, Settings) with pass/fail criteria and edge case identification
**Depends on**: Phase 51
**Research**: Unlikely (internal testing — reviewing own app features)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:

- [ ] 52-01: TBD

#### Phase 53: Unlisted App Store Release
