# Roadmap: Camera/Darkroom UX Refactor

## Overview

This roadmap transforms the Camera and Darkroom experience from two separate tabs into a unified, native-feeling iOS interface. Starting with navigation restructuring, we'll progressively add the darkroom button, implement press-and-hold reveals with haptic feedback, replace buttons with iOS Mail-style swipe gestures, add celebratory success moments, and polish the visual design system across all camera controls.

Animation Changes:
- Darkroom opens from bottom (slide up) instead of from the side after press-and-hold reveal
- Darkroom closes by falling towards bottom of screen (slide down)
- Change back arrow icon from left-pointing to down-pointing to indicate dismiss direction

Triage Completion UX:
- Remove navigation to separate success screen after completing triage
- Stay on darkroom screen and transition empty state to success message state
- Smoother, less janky experience when all photos are triaged

#### Phase 17.2: Reveal Timing 0-5 Minutes (INSERTED) - Complete

**Goal**: Change darkroom reveal timing from 0-15 minutes to 0-5 minutes for faster photo reveals
**Depends on**: Phase 17.1

Plans:
- [x] 17.2-01: Update client/server reveal timing to 0-5 minutes - completed 2026-01-22

**Delivered:**

- Cloud Functions deployed to Firebase

#### Phase 18: Reaction Notification Debouncing (Complete)

#### Phase 18.1: Batched Darkroom Triage with Undo (INSERTED) - In Progress

**Goal**: Batch triage decisions locally until user confirms, with undo capability and session persistence
**Depends on**: Phase 18
**Research**: Unlikely (React Native state management and AsyncStorage patterns)
**Plans**: 1/2 complete

Plans:
- [x] 18.1-01: Undo stack state and UI - completed 2026-01-22
- [ ] 18.1-02: Done button batch save and undo animation

**Details:**
Current behavior: Triage choices (archive/journal/delete) save immediately to Firestore on swipe, no undo option.

New behavior:
- Triage decisions stored locally during session (not saved to Firestore until confirmed)
- Undo button at top of screen to reverse last decision and re-triage that photo
- "Done" or "Back to Camera" button finalizes and saves all decisions to Firestore
- If darkroom closed mid-triage (app backgrounded, crash, etc.), session persists via AsyncStorage
- Reopening darkroom restores the same batch with any previous local decisions intact

#### Phase 18.2: Success Sound Effect on Triage Completion (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Play a celebratory sound clip when user finishes triaging all photos (during success screen)
**Depends on**: Phase 18.1
**Research**: Unlikely (expo-av already available for audio playback)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 18.2-01: TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 18.2 to break down)

**Details:**
- Add satisfying audio feedback when all photos are triaged
- Sound plays during the inline success state (sparkles animation)
- Use expo-av for audio playback
- Consider: chime, whoosh, or subtle celebration sound
- Ensure sound respects device silent mode settings

#### Phase 18.3: Triage Animation Z-Index & Delete Suction Effect (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Fix photo card animations rendering over triage buttons and add suction effect for delete action
**Depends on**: Phase 18.2
**Research**: Unlikely (React Native Reanimated z-index and animation patterns)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 18.3-01: TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 18.3 to break down)

**Details:**
Z-Index Fix:
- Photo card triage animations currently render on top of the triage buttons
- Cards should animate behind the button bar, not over it
- Ensure proper z-index layering during all animation states

Delete Suction Effect:
- Current delete animation: card falls straight down off screen
- New behavior: card should get "sucked into" the delete button
- Animation should scale down and move toward delete button position
- Creates satisfying visual feedback that the photo is being deleted
