## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Auth Shared Components

**Plans**: 1/1 complete

Plans:

- [x] 01-01: Dark theme Button/Input updates + AuthCodeInput component

### Phase 2: Login Screen Refactor

**Goal**: Apply dark theme to login screen, improve UX to match app aesthetic
**Depends on**: Phase 1

Plans:
