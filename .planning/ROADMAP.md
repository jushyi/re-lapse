# Roadmap: Auth & Profile Refactor

## Overview

Transform Lapse Clone's authentication experience and profile system from inconsistent placeholders into polished, cohesive screens that match the app's established dark aesthetic. This journey starts with shared auth components, refactors login/signup flows, extends onboarding to capture full profile data, and builds out the profile screen with Selects banner, profile song, and album galleries.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**

- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

_v1.6 phases complete. See [v1.6-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.6-ROADMAP.md) for archive._
_v0.9.0 phases complete. See [v0.9.0-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v0.9.0-ROADMAP.md) for archive._

### 🚧 v1.0.0 Release Readiness (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Optimize performance, establish testing infrastructure, and ship the first iOS release with CI/CD pipelines for future updates

**Constraints:**

- iOS only — no Android release in this milestone
- Unlisted release (not searchable, direct link access only)
- Privacy policy and ToS already exist, just need linking
- Apple Developer account partially set up — certificates/profiles still needed
- UAT should cover all 45 previously shipped phases across 8 feature areas

#### Phase 46: Performance Optimization

**Goal**: Firebase queries, UI rendering, and Cloud Functions code-level improvements — composite indexes, pagination, read/write batching, offline caching, FlatList optimization, image caching & lazy loading, native driver animations, React.memo/useMemo re-render reduction, cold start reduction, memory/timeout tuning
**Depends on**: Previous milestone complete
**Research**: Likely (Firebase optimization best practices, composite index configuration, Cloud Functions cold start patterns)
**Research topics**: Firebase composite indexes, query pagination patterns, Cloud Functions cold start reduction, React Native FlatList optimization
**Plans**: 7

Plans:

- [x] 46-01: Feed Query Server-Side Filtering
- [ ] 46-02: Firestore Indexes & Read Optimization
- [ ] 46-03: Image Loading & Caching
- [ ] 46-04: FlatList & React Rendering
- [ ] 46-05: React Compiler & Build Config
- [ ] 46-06: Cloud Functions Performance
- [ ] 46-07: Verification & Documentation

#### Phase 47: Firebase Performance Monitoring

**Goal**: Integrate Firebase Performance Monitoring SDK for ongoing production metrics — network traces, custom traces, screen rendering performance, baseline establishment
**Depends on**: Phase 46
**Research**: Likely (new SDK integration — not currently in codebase)
**Research topics**: Firebase Performance Monitoring SDK setup for React Native/Expo, custom trace API, network trace configuration
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:

- [ ] 47-01: TBD

#### Phase 48: UI/UX Consistency Audit

**Goal**: Review all screens for visual and interaction consistency — spacing, colors, typography, component patterns, navigation flows, gesture patterns, loading/error states, feedback patterns
**Depends on**: Phase 47
**Research**: Unlikely (internal patterns — reviewing and standardizing existing code)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:

- [ ] 48-01: TBD

#### Phase 49: Automated Test Suite

**Goal**: Jest unit tests for business logic + Detox E2E tests for critical user flows (auth, camera, feed, social) — regression guards for future development
**Depends on**: Phase 48
**Research**: Likely (Detox E2E framework likely new to project)
**Research topics**: Detox setup with Expo/React Native, Jest configuration for React Native, test structure patterns
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:

- [ ] 49-01: TBD

#### Phase 50: CI/CD Pipeline

**Goal**: GitHub Actions for lint/type-check/test on PR, EAS Build on merge to main, EAS Submit on release tag — Apple credentials and EAS tokens in GitHub Secrets
**Depends on**: Phase 49
**Research**: Likely (EAS Build/Submit integration, GitHub Actions workflows)
**Research topics**: EAS Build configuration, GitHub Actions for Expo/EAS, secrets management, pipeline validation
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:

- [ ] 50-01: TBD

#### Phase 51: iOS Release Preparation

**Goal**: Finish distribution certificate + App Store provisioning profile, configure App Store Connect (bundle ID, metadata, screenshots), link existing privacy policy/ToS
**Depends on**: Phase 50
**Research**: Likely (Apple Developer portal, certificates, provisioning profiles, App Store Connect)
**Research topics**: Distribution certificate creation, App Store provisioning, EAS credentials setup, App Store Connect metadata
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:

- [ ] 51-01: TBD

#### Phase 52: Systematic UAT

**Goal**: Manual testing checklists across all 8 feature areas (Auth, Profile, Camera/Photos, Feed, Stories, Social, Notifications, Settings) with pass/fail criteria and edge case identification
**Depends on**: Phase 51
**Research**: Unlikely (internal testing — reviewing own app features)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:

- [ ] 52-01: TBD

#### Phase 53: Unlisted App Store Release

**Goal**: Build via EAS Build, submit via EAS Submit, pass App Review, publish as unlisted (direct link only, not searchable)
**Depends on**: Phase 52
**Research**: Likely (EAS Submit, App Review process, unlisted distribution)
**Research topics**: EAS Submit configuration, App Review requirements, unlisted app distribution setup
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:

- [ ] 53-01: TBD
