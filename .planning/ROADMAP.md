# Roadmap: Camera/Darkroom UX Refactor

## Overview

This roadmap transforms the Camera and Darkroom experience from two separate tabs into a unified, native-feeling iOS interface. Starting with navigation restructuring, we'll progressively add the darkroom button, implement press-and-hold reveals with haptic feedback, replace buttons with iOS Mail-style swipe gestures, add celebratory success moments, and polish the visual design system across all camera controls.

### 🚧 v1.3 Firebase SDK Consolidation (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Unify all Firebase services under React Native Firebase SDK to fix permission-denied errors caused by SDK auth state mismatch

#### Phase 9: Firestore Services Migration

**Goal**: Migrate photoService.js, feedService.js, friendshipService.js, and darkroomService.js from Firebase JS SDK to React Native Firebase
**Depends on**: v1.2 complete
**Research**: Not needed (AuthContext.js already demonstrates correct RN Firebase pattern)

Plans:
- [x] 09-01: Core Photo Services Migration (photoService.js, darkroomService.js) - completed 2026-01-19
- [ ] 09-02: Social Services Migration (feedService.js, friendshipService.js)

#### Phase 10: Storage Migration & Cleanup

**Goal**: Migrate storageService.js to RN Firebase, remove JS SDK dependencies, verify all functionality works
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Research**: Unlikely (following same migration pattern)

Plans:
- [ ] 10-01: TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 10 to break down)
