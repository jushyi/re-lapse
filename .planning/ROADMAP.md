# Roadmap: Camera/Darkroom UX Refactor

## Overview

This roadmap transforms the Camera and Darkroom experience from two separate tabs into a unified, native-feeling iOS interface. Starting with navigation restructuring, we'll progressively add the darkroom button, implement press-and-hold reveals with haptic feedback, replace buttons with iOS Mail-style swipe gestures, add celebratory success moments, and polish the visual design system across all camera controls.
