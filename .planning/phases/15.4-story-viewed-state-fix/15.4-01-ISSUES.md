## Resolved Issues

### UAT-001: Reactions not persisting after close/reopen stories

**Resolved:** 2026-02-03
**Fix:** 15.4-01-FIX Task 1 (commit 0af24f3)
**Solution:** Added `setFriendStories` call in `handleStoriesReactionToggle` to persist reaction data in state, not just ref

**Resolved:** 2026-02-03
**Fix:** 15.4-01-FIX Task 2 (commit d507743)
**Solution:** Added `viewedPhotoCount` to useViewedStories return, destructured in FeedScreen to create render dependency

### UAT-003: Own story doesn't resume at correct position

**Resolved:** 2026-02-03
**Fix:** 15.4-01-FIX Task 2 (commit d507743)
**Solution:** Same fix as UAT-002 - re-render dependency ensures resume position is recalculated correctly
