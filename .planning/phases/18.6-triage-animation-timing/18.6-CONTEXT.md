# Phase 18.6: Triage Animation Timing Optimization - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When triaging photos, the motion should feel like flipping through a deck of cards in one continuous flow. Right now there's a noticeable pause after a card exits before the next card starts moving forward — that dead time breaks the rhythm.

The next card should start its cascade animation as soon as the exiting card clears visual overlap with the stack. The animations should overlap, creating a continuous, fluid motion where one card flows seamlessly into the next. No perceptible gap between exit and cascade.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **No perceptible gap** - Eliminate the pause/delay between card exit and cascade animation
- **Smooth continuity** - The motion should feel like one continuous gesture, not two separate animations with a wait in between

Both are equally important — can't have one without the other.

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- Changing animation speeds - Keep current exit and cascade durations exactly the same
- Visual changes to animations - No changes to arcs, rotations, overlays, or any visual characteristics
- Rapid-fire optimization - Natural triage pace is fine, no need to optimize for speed-triaging
- Different timing for swipe vs button - Whatever works best technically, consistency doesn't matter

This is purely a timing fix. Nothing else changes.

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Cascade should trigger when exiting card clears visual overlap with the stack (not at 80% exit or arbitrary percentage)
- Both swipe and button triage should benefit from this fix
- The trigger point is visual: when the exiting card no longer overlaps the next card

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

The roadmap description captures it well: "Animation speed should stay the same (no faster exit). Next card animation should trigger as soon as exiting card clears, or even overlap slightly."

The key insight is that this is about eliminating dead time, not speeding anything up.
