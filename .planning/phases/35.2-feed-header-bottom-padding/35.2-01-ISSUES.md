## Resolved Issues

### UAT-001: App crashes on launch - FlatList not wrapped for Animated onScroll

**Discovered:** 2026-01-25
**Resolved:** 2026-01-25 - Fixed inline during UAT
**Phase/Plan:** 35.2-01
**Severity:** Blocker
**Feature:** Scroll-hide header animation
**Description:** App crashed immediately on launch with error "Invariant Violation: Components based on VirtualizedList must be wrapped with Animated.createAnimatedComponent to support native onScroll events with useNativeDriver"
**Fix:** Changed `FlatList` to `Animated.FlatList` in FeedScreen.js

### UAT-002: Header overlaps iOS status bar

**Discovered:** 2026-01-25
**Resolved:** 2026-01-25 - Fixed inline during UAT
**Phase/Plan:** 35.2-01
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Black header background
**Description:** Header with `position: absolute` and `top: 0` was overlapping the iOS status bar (time, wifi, battery icons) instead of being positioned below it
**Fix:** Added `useSafeAreaInsets` hook and set `top: insets.top` on header

### UAT-003: Header doesn't fully hide when scrolling

**Discovered:** 2026-01-25
**Resolved:** 2026-01-25 - Fixed inline during UAT
**Phase/Plan:** 35.2-01
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** Scroll-hide header animation
**Description:** Header animation only moved by HEADER_HEIGHT, but since header starts at insets.top, it didn't fully hide
**Fix:** Updated outputRange to `-(HEADER_HEIGHT + insets.top)` to fully hide header

### UAT-004: Header passes through status bar when hiding

**Discovered:** 2026-01-25
**Resolved:** 2026-01-25 - Fixed inline during UAT
**Phase/Plan:** 35.2-01
**Severity:** Cosmetic
**Feature:** Scroll-hide header animation
**Description:** Header was visible passing through the status bar area (behind wifi/battery icons) when scrolling
**Fix:** Added statusBarMask View with zIndex: 11 (above header's zIndex: 10) to cover the safe area and hide the header as it scrolls up

### UAT-005: Large gap between header and stories row

**Discovered:** 2026-01-25
**Resolved:** 2026-01-25 - Fixed inline during UAT
**Phase/Plan:** 35.2-01
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Feed layout
**Description:** Double-counting of safe area insets caused excessive padding - SafeAreaView adds insets.top, then FlatList paddingTop was adding it again
**Fix:** Changed FlatList contentContainerStyle paddingTop from `HEADER_HEIGHT + insets.top` to just `HEADER_HEIGHT`

### UAT-006: Tap to advance stories doesn't work

**Discovered:** 2026-01-25
**Resolved:** 2026-01-25 - Fixed inline during UAT
**Phase/Plan:** 35.2-01
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Stories navigation
**Description:** PanResponder's `onStartShouldSetPanResponder` was returning true for all touches above footer, capturing them before TouchableWithoutFeedback could handle taps
**Fix:** Changed `onStartShouldSetPanResponder` and `onStartShouldSetPanResponderCapture` to return false, allowing taps to pass through while still capturing swipe gestures via `onMoveShouldSetPanResponder`

### UAT-007: Name positioned too high above progress bar

**Discovered:** 2026-01-25
**Resolved:** 2026-01-25 - Fixed inline during UAT
**Phase/Plan:** 35.2-01
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** Stories modal layout
**Description:** userInfoOverlay had `bottom: 140` which positioned the name too far above the progress bar
**Fix:** Changed `bottom` from 140 to 108 in PhotoDetailModal.styles.js

### UAT-008: Swipe-down-to-close broken for feed modal

**Discovered:** 2026-01-25
**Resolved:** 2026-01-25 - Fixed inline during UAT
**Phase/Plan:** 35.2-01
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Feed photo modal
**Description:** After fixing tap navigation (UAT-006), swipe-to-close stopped working for feed mode. The PanResponder's `onMoveShouldSetPanResponder` requires an initial touch responder to transfer from. Stories mode had TouchableWithoutFeedback, but feed mode had a plain View.
**Fix:** Unified both modes to use a single TouchableWithoutFeedback wrapper, with onPress conditionally set for stories mode only
