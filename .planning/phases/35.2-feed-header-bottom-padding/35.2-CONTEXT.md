# Phase 35.2: Feed Header & Bottom Padding - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The feed gets a proper header that behaves like Instagram - a black header bar with logo and notifications bell that smoothly slides up when scrolling down through photos, and slides back down when scrolling up. The animation should track scroll velocity for a natural, buttery feel.

The bottom of the feed needs padding so the last card's info section isn't clipped by the tab bar - content should end comfortably above the navigation.

Additionally, the photo modal layout changes: story segments (the progress indicators) move from the top to the bottom of the screen. The bottom of the photo modal should stack: name/timestamp first, then story segments below that, then reactions at the very bottom.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Smooth scroll-hide behavior** - Header slides up/down tracking scroll velocity, feels buttery and responsive
- **Bottom padding for feed** - Last card's info section fully visible above tab bar
- **Both equally critical** - Can't ship without both working well

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- Search bar in header - just logo + notifications bell
- Custom header animations beyond hide/show - no fancy effects
- Header content changes - keep it minimal (logo + bell only)

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Header: black background matching feed, contains Rewind logo + activity bell (current FeedScreen setup)
- Scroll behavior: smooth slide transition tracking velocity (not snap hide/show)
- Photo modal layout reorder: name/timestamp → story segments → reactions (all at bottom)
- Story segments only visible in stories mode (per Phase 35.1 unified modal)

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This phase builds on Phase 35.1 (Unified Photo Modal) which establishes the conditional story segments. Phase 35.2 repositions those segments within the modal and adds the feed-level header/padding polish.
