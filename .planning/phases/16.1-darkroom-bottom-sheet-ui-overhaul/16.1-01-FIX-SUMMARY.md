# Phase 16.1 Plan 01-FIX: UAT-003 Spinner Fixes Summary

**YouTube-style spinner with 3/4 arc rotating around static play icon, 3x speed boost on hold, and correct button text**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 15 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-21T15:00:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-21T15:15:00Z
- **Tasks:** 1 (+ 1 verification checkpoint)
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Replaced 3-dot spinner with 3/4 arc ring + static play triangle
- Ring rotates around the static play icon (not entire element)
- Spinner speeds up 3x during hold (667ms vs 2000ms)
- Button text changed to "Hold to reveal photos" / "Revealing..."

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Fix UAT-003** - Multiple iterations:
   - `91c4d11` - Initial fix (spinner design, animation reset, button text)
   - `83b8283` - Segmented ring, static play icon, 3x speed
   - `b2a40fc` - 2/3 arc + trailing dots attempt
   - `6f920c7` - 6 dots evenly spaced
   - `27065ca` - Correct dot arc positions
   - `533ccf3` - Dots on ring edge
   - `f831198` - Final: simple 3/4 arc, no dots

**Final working commit:** `f831198`

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/DarkroomBottomSheet.js` - New SpinnerIcon with 3/4 arc ring around static play triangle, 3x speed boost

## Decisions Made

- Simple 3/4 arc with 1/4 gap preferred over complex dot patterns
- Play icon must remain static in center while only ring rotates
- 3x speed increase (not 2x) provides better visual feedback during hold

## Deviations from Plan

### Iterative Design

Multiple spinner designs were tested with user feedback:
1. Segmented ring with dots - dots didn't follow arc properly
2. 2/3 arc + 6 trailing dots - spacing issues
3. Final: 3/4 solid arc, no dots - approved by user

---

**Total deviations:** 0 (iterative design refinement based on user feedback)
**Impact on plan:** Design iteration expected for UI polish work

## Issues Encountered

- Dot positioning along circular arc was challenging with absolute positioning
- User preferred simpler 3/4 arc design over complex dot patterns

## Next Phase Readiness

- UAT-003 resolved, Phase 16.1 fully complete
- Ready to proceed to Phase 16.2: Fix 0.5x Ultra-Wide Zoom
