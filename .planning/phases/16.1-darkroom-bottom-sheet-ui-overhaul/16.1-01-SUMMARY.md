# Phase 16.1 Plan 01: Darkroom Bottom Sheet UI Overhaul Summary

**Dark themed bottom sheet with neon purple hold-to-reveal interaction, card stack header, and crescendo haptic feedback**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-21T20:25:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-21T20:33:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2 (+ 1 verification checkpoint)
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments

- Redesigned DarkroomBottomSheet with dark theme (#1A1A1A background, white text)
- Added header layout with "Darkroom" title, status dot (green/red), and status text
- Implemented card stack display (1-4 fanned cards) in header top-right
- Created neon purple gradient hold button using expo-linear-gradient
- Implemented fill animation (left-to-right, 1600ms - 1.25x faster)
- Added spinner icon that spins 2x faster during hold
- Implemented crescendo haptic feedback with 4 intensity phases

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Dark theme + header/card stack layout** - `166db78` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Neon purple hold-to-reveal with crescendo haptics** - `d25f1d5` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** (this commit) (docs: complete plan)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/DarkroomBottomSheet.js` - Complete redesign with dark theme, header, card stack, and purple hold button
- `package.json` - Added expo-linear-gradient dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated lockfile

## Decisions Made

- **Custom spinner component:** Used View-based dots with varying opacity instead of SVG dependency for consistency with existing patterns
- **Crescendo haptic configuration:** 4 phases with decreasing intervals (400ms→300ms→200ms→150ms) and increasing intensity (Light→Light→Medium→Heavy)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - verification will capture issues in next phase.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 16.1 complete, ready for Phase 17: Darkroom UX Polish
- Bottom sheet UI redesign provides foundation for additional darkroom improvements
