## Resolved Issues

### UAT-003: Spinner design and animation not working as expected (RESOLVED)

**Discovered:** 2026-01-21
**Phase/Plan:** 16.1-01
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** Hold-to-reveal button spinner
**Description:**
1. Spinner doesn't look right - user wants YouTube-style spinner with a play button inside
2. Spinner animation doesn't function - neither initial spin nor speed-up during hold works
3. Button text is wrong - should say "Hold to reveal photos" instead of current text
**Resolution:** Fixed in 16.1-01-FIX (second pass). 3/4 arc ring rotates around static play triangle. Spinner speeds up 3x during hold. Button text changed to "Hold to reveal photos".
**Resolved:** 2026-01-21

### UAT-001: Status text format incorrect (RESOLVED)

**Discovered:** 2026-01-21
**Phase/Plan:** 16.1-01
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** Dark theme header layout
**Description:** Status text shows "(15) ready to reveal" but should read "15 photos ready to reveal" with the number inline.
**Resolution:** Fixed in 16.1-01-FIX. Changed format to "X photos ready to reveal" with singular/plural handling ("1 photo" vs "X photos").
**Resolved:** 2026-01-21

### UAT-002: Linear gradient shows "unimplemented component" (RESOLVED)

**Discovered:** 2026-01-21
**Phase/Plan:** 16.1-01
**Severity:** Blocker
**Feature:** Neon purple hold-to-reveal button
**Description:** The expo-linear-gradient component shows "unimplemented component" text instead of rendering the purple gradient.
**Resolution:** Fixed in 16.1-01-FIX. Replaced LinearGradient with solid color Views. Solid purple base (#7C3AED) with lighter purple fill (#A855F7). Gradients deferred to future rebuild.
**Resolved:** 2026-01-21
