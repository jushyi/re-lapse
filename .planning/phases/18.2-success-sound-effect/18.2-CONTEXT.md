# Phase 18.2: Success Sound Effect on Triage Completion - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-22
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When the user finishes triaging all their photos and sees the success screen with sparkles animation, a celebratory sound plays. The user has already selected a specific MP3 file in the assets folder — this is the exact sound they want, no need to source alternatives.

The sound should feel like a satisfying completion moment, playing in sync with the sparkles animation to create a cohesive celebration.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Perfect timing with sparkles** — Sound should sync precisely with the success animation for a cohesive celebration moment
- **Reliability** — Must play every time triage completes, no silent failures
- **Respects silent mode** — Sound should not play when the device is silenced

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- Volume control or user settings to enable/disable sound
- Multiple sound options or a sound picker
- Any audio customization — just play the one MP3 file

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- User has already added their chosen MP3 file to the assets folder
- Use expo-av for audio playback (already noted in roadmap)
- Sound plays during inline success state (after all photos triaged)

</specifics>

## Additional Context

No additional notes — straightforward feature with a clear, specific sound file already provided.
