# Phase 17.1: Darkroom Animation Refinements - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-22
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The darkroom should feel like a native iOS drawer/sheet. When triggered after press-and-hold reveal, it slides up from the bottom of the screen. When dismissed, it slides back down — smooth drawer-style behavior, not a side navigation.

When the user swipes away the last photo card, the success state is revealed underneath — no navigation to a separate screen. The last card's swipe gesture already animates it away, so the background simply fades in behind it with a brief confetti animation, "Photos saved!" message, and a "Done" button that returns to the camera.

The back arrow icon should point downward to indicate the dismiss direction matches the slide-down animation.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Inline success state** — No navigation away when triage completes. The success state reveals right there on the same screen as the last card swipes away.
- **Drawer-style open/close** — Darkroom slides up from bottom to open, slides down to close. Native iOS sheet feel.
- **Seamless reveal** — Last card swipe reveals success state underneath with confetti, no jarring transitions.

## What's Out of Scope

- Undo capability — that's Phase 18.1 (Batched Darkroom Triage with Undo)
- Haptic refinements — keeping existing three-stage haptics as-is
- Any changes to the swipe gestures themselves — just the open/close animations and success state

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Confetti should be subtle and brief — tasteful celebration, not over-the-top
- "Photos saved!" message with "Done" button for returning to camera
- Down-pointing arrow icon instead of left-pointing back arrow
- Background with success state fades in as last card animates away from swipe

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This phase focuses purely on animation polish and the inline success flow. The goal is eliminating the janky navigation jump when triage completes and making the darkroom feel more like a native iOS sheet.
