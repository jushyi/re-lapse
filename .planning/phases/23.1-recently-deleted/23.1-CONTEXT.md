# Phase 23.1: Recently Deleted Photos - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-05
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Like the iOS Photos app "Recently Deleted" album. When users delete a photo — whether from the photo management menu or accidentally during Darkroom triage — it goes to Recently Deleted instead of being immediately destroyed.

Users access Recently Deleted from Settings. They see a grid of deleted photos, each with a countdown overlay showing how many days remain before permanent deletion (30-day grace period). They can tap individual photos to view full-screen, or use multi-select to batch restore or permanently delete.

The whole experience should feel like a safety net. Deletion anxiety goes away because you know you can recover mistakes. The countdown keeps things clear — you know exactly when photos will be gone for good.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **iOS Photos-style experience** — Familiar pattern with dedicated screen, countdown badges, clear restore/delete actions
- **Safety net for all deletions** — Both photo menu deletions AND Darkroom triage deletions go to Recently Deleted
- **Clear countdown visibility** — Overlay on each thumbnail showing days remaining
- **Easy restoration** — Quick restore flow with no friction when users change their mind

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- Push notifications (no reminders about photos about to expire)
- Storage management (no showing space used by deleted photos)
- Profile-level access (Settings only, not a visible album on profile)

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Multi-select support for bulk restore and bulk permanent delete
- Match existing 3-column photo grid style (like monthly albums, album pickers)
- Confirmation dialog when permanently deleting (bypassing the 30-day grace period)
- Full-screen photo viewer reuses existing album viewer pattern with restore/delete in menu
- Countdown badge overlay on each thumbnail in the grid
- Darkroom triage deletions captured — accidental swipe-to-delete gets the 30-day safety net

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

Similar infrastructure pattern to Phase 19 account deletion — soft delete with scheduled cleanup. Auto-cleanup via scheduled function processes photos past their 30-day grace period.

User emphasized the complete iOS Photos experience — countdown, safety net feeling, and easy restoration are all equally important, not just one aspect.
