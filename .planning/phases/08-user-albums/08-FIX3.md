  <name>Task 1: Fix UAT-012 - Redesign empty album state</name>

  <action>
When user has no albums, replace the small AddAlbumCard with a full-width prompt:

Empty state container:

- Full width of album bar area (with horizontal padding matching rest of profile)
- Height: ~100px or similar to album card height
- Dashed border: 1px, gray (#555 or similar)
- Background: subtle gray (rgba(255,255,255,0.03))
- Border radius: 12px
- Centered content:
  - Text: "Tap here to make your first album"
  - Text color: gray (#888)
  - Font size: 14-15
- TouchableOpacity with same onPress as AddAlbumCard (navigate to CreateAlbum)

When 1+ albums exist:

- Keep current behavior: albums list + AddAlbumCard at end
  </action>
  <verify>

1. Delete all albums (or test with new user)
2. Profile shows full-width "Tap here to make your first album" prompt
3. Tapping navigates to CreateAlbumScreen
4. After creating album, normal album bar with add button at end
   </verify>
   <done>Empty state shows full-width tappable prompt</done>
   </task>
