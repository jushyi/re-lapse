# Phase 48: UI/UX Consistency Audit - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A systematic screen-by-screen sweep through the entire app, walking through each screen, button, popup, and menu together with Claude. The goal is to identify and fix inconsistencies inline as we go — spacing, colors, typography, component patterns, navigation flows, gesture patterns, loading states, error handling, and feedback patterns.

The standard is the best existing screens in the app. Some screens already look great — use those as the benchmark and bring everything else up to that level. Both visual consistency and interaction consistency matter equally — the app should look AND feel cohesive.

The approach is interactive and incremental: walk through screens together, fix small things inline, and split across multiple plans to avoid running out of context.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Visual consistency** — spacing, colors, typography, and component styling should feel like they belong to the same app across every screen
- **Interaction consistency** — gestures, navigation, loading states, error handling, and feedback should behave predictably everywhere
- **Bring everything up to the best screens' level** — the strongest screens set the standard, everything else gets tightened to match

## What's Out of Scope

- No new features or functionality — purely polish
- No redesigns or layout changes — keep current layouts and structure
- Strictly consistency fixes: same layouts, same features, just tightened up

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Settings and secondary screens need the most attention — main screens are already solid
- Menus (popups, context menus, action sheets) also need attention
- Modals and less-visited screens may not match the polish of primary screens
- Small inline fixes — not big overhauls
- Multiple plans to split the work and avoid context exhaustion

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

The user wants an interactive walkthrough approach: go screen by screen with Claude, review each element (buttons, popups, menus), and fix things inline. Multiple plans are expected so we don't run out of context — each plan covers a group of screens or feature area.
