# Phase 21.2: EAS Secure Google Services File - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-24
**Status:** Ready for research

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Use EAS's built-in file environment variable feature to inject GoogleService-Info.plist at build time. The plist lives entirely outside of version control — stored in EAS secrets — and automatically appears in the correct location when EAS runs a build.

When someone needs to update the Firebase config (rare, but possible), the process should be straightforward: update the secret in EAS, trigger a new build. No arcane incantations or remembering obscure steps.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Builds just work** — EAS builds succeed without manual intervention, plist appears where iOS expects it
- **Zero secrets in repo** — The plist never touches git history, completely external to version control
- **Easy updates** — If Firebase config changes, updating the secret should be straightforward (not arcane)
- **Full verification** — Confidence at every step: build succeeds, logs confirm injection, app works on device

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- Android configuration (google-services.json) — iOS only for this phase
- Multiple environments (dev/staging/production) — just production plist for now
- Complex CI/CD workflows — using EAS's native capabilities, not custom build scripts

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Keep app.json/eas.json changes minimal
- Document the process clearly for future plist updates
- Should be able to see/verify the secret exists in EAS dashboard
- Build logs should show confirmation that file was injected

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This phase follows the API key exposure remediation (21.1). The goal is ensuring EAS builds work correctly now that GoogleService-Info.plist is no longer in the repository.

Priority is HIGH — required for successful EAS builds going forward.
