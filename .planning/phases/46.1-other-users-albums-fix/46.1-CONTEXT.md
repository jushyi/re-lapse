# Phase 46.1: Other Users Albums View Fix - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** Ready for research

<vision>
## How This Should Work

This is a regression fix — viewing other users' albums was previously working as a view-only gallery experience. When you tap into someone else's album on their profile, you should see their photos in a read-only gallery view. All the infrastructure for this was already built and functioning. Something during the v0.9.0 Engagement & Polish milestone (Phases 32-45) broke it.

The goal is to restore the exact previous behavior — tap an album on another user's profile, see their photos in the view-only gallery, just like before.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Restore working album viewing** — Tapping into another user's album shows their photos in the view-only gallery, exactly as it worked before
- **Prevent regression** — Whatever broke it should be fixed in a way that makes it harder to break again

## What's Out of Scope

- No new album features — no adding likes, comments, sharing, or any new functionality to albums
- No UI changes — don't change how albums look or feel, just fix the underlying bug
- Strictly a bug fix — restore what was working, nothing more

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — this is a pure regression fix. The previous behavior is the spec.

## Additional Context

Regression occurred sometime during v0.9.0 work (Phases 32-45). Investigation should focus on changes made in that milestone that could have affected album viewing for other users — likely query changes, navigation updates, or permission/visibility logic changes.
