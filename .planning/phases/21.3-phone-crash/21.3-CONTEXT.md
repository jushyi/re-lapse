# Phase 21.3: App Crashes When Inputting Phone Number - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-24
**Status:** Ready for research

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When a user enters their phone number and submits, the app should navigate to a verification screen where they can enter the SMS code they receive. The flow should be smooth: enter phone → submit → move to verification screen → enter code → authenticated.

Currently, the app crashes after entering the full phone number, likely on submit. This is a 100% reproducible crash that completely blocks the authentication flow.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Fix the crash** - Phone input must work without crashing the app
- **Restore working auth flow** - User can complete phone verification end-to-end

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- UX improvements to phone input - just fix the crash
- Better phone number validation/formatting - not this phase
- Any other auth flow changes - minimal fix only

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

**Suspected cause:** In Phase 7 (Legacy Auth Removal & Cleanup), email and Apple Sign-In were removed. During this cleanup, the Google Sign-In provider may have been accidentally removed as well. Phone auth with Firebase requires reCAPTCHA verification, which was configured with Google Sign-In in Phase 6. If this provider configuration was removed, it could cause the crash.

This theory should be investigated during research.

## Additional Context

- Phase 6 implemented phone auth with reCAPTCHA
- Phase 7 removed legacy auth (email + Apple Sign-In)
- The crash is 100% reproducible
- Priority: URGENT - user-facing crash blocking authentication
