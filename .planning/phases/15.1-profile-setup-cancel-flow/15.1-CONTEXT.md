# Phase 15.1: Profile Setup Cancel Flow - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When a user starts profile setup after entering their phone number, they should be able to back out if they change their mind — but only from the first screen of the setup flow. A back arrow in the header (standard iOS pattern) allows them to exit.

Tapping back always shows a confirmation dialog, even if they haven't entered anything yet. This is important because canceling means deleting their partial profile data from the database. The dialog is a standard iOS alert — simple and native-feeling.

If they confirm, their in-progress profile data is cleaned up from the database and they return to the phone number input screen. The whole thing should feel natural, not jarring.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Clean data cleanup** - The partial profile must be completely removed from the database when they cancel
- **Clear user messaging** - User understands what they're doing and what gets deleted
- **Smooth navigation** - Getting back to phone input feels natural, not jarring

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- Mid-flow cancellation - Cancel only available from first profile setup screen, not from steps 2/3/4
- Data recovery - No "resume where you left off" if they come back later with same phone number
- Fancy animations - Simple dialog and navigation, no elaborate transitions
- Custom styled modal - Using standard iOS Alert.alert, not a custom dark-themed modal

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Back arrow (chevron) in header on first profile setup screen
- Standard iOS Alert.alert for confirmation dialog
- "Cancel" and "Yes, exit" (or similar) as dialog buttons
- Navigation returns to phone number input screen after confirmation

## Additional Context

This phase was added to address the case where users start profile setup with a new phone number but want to back out. Currently there's no way to cancel — they're forced to complete the flow.

The focus is on the first screen only because once users start investing time filling in profile data, they should commit to finishing. The confirmation dialog is always shown (even with empty fields) because the action still deletes their profile record from the database.
