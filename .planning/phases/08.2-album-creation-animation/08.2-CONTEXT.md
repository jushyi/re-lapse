# Phase 8.2: Album Creation Animation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-29
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When a user creates a new album and returns to the profile screen, the app should provide clear visual feedback that their album was created successfully. The profile screen scrolls down to reveal the albums bar if it's not currently visible, then the album bar smoothly scrolls to show the new album, and the new album card does a subtle scale bounce animation to draw the eye.

The animation should feel like Instagram highlights - smooth, polished, and native. It confirms success without being disruptive or over-the-top.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Clear visual confirmation** - User immediately knows their album was created successfully
- **Smooth, polished feel** - Animation quality matters, should feel native and refined
- **Not disruptive** - Subtle enough it doesn't interrupt the flow

All three aspects are equally important for this to work well.

## What's Out of Scope

- No sound effects - just visual animation
- No success toast/banner - no separate "Album created" message overlay
- No complex particle effects - no confetti, sparkles, or elaborate celebration effects

Keep it clean and subtle.

## Specific Ideas

- Instagram highlights style animation as reference
- Profile screen should scroll down to albums bar first if it's not visible
- Album bar then scrolls horizontally to the new album position
- New album card does a scale bounce (slightly grows then settles back to normal size)
- iOS native feel with spring-based motion

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

The albums bar may not be visible when returning to the profile screen - users sometimes need to scroll down to see it. The animation sequence should handle this: first scroll the profile to show albums, then scroll the album bar to the new album, then highlight.
