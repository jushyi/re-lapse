# Phase 3.1: Auth Input Field Fixes - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-27
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The phone number input should feel seamless when users need to correct mistakes. Backspacing through the formatted number should work naturally — the parentheses and formatting characters shouldn't create obstacles or get "stuck" when deleting digits. Users should be able to erase their way back through the number without fighting the auto-formatting.

For profile setup inputs (username, display name, bio), the existing placeholder hints are appropriate and should remain. The fix is simply removing whatever auto-filled letters are currently appearing inappropriately — inputs should start clean with just the placeholder text visible.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Phone input backspace behavior** — This is the blocker. Users currently can't easily correct their phone number after entering 3+ digits because backspace gets stuck on the parenthesis. This must work smoothly.
- **Clean input appearance** — Profile setup inputs should show only placeholder hints, not auto-filled letters.

## What's Out of Scope

- No redesigning inputs or changing styling
- No adding validation messages or error states
- No phone number validation or country code logic
- No new features — just fix the bugs

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — just fix the existing bugs without over-engineering.

## Additional Context

This is an urgent bug fix phase (inserted as 3.1) that blocks the flow. The phone input usability issue is the higher priority — it prevents users from correcting mistakes during signup.
