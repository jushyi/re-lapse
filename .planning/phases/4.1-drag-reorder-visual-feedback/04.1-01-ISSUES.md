### UAT-001: Dragged item flashes to old position on drop

**Discovered:** 2026-01-27
**Resolved:** 2026-01-27
**Phase/Plan:** 04.1-01
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Smooth drop animation
**Description:** When releasing a dragged thumbnail after repositioning, the item briefly flashed back to its original position before settling into the new target position.
**Root cause:** React reused component instances by index (key={index}), causing content to swap instantly before LayoutAnimation could run.
**Fix:**

1. Added LayoutAnimation.configureNext before handleReorder state update
2. Changed DraggableThumbnail key from `index` to `photoId` for stable component identity
3. Added withDelay(16ms) + withTiming(200ms) to sync transform reset with LayoutAnimation
   **Commit:** 7770553, 4347633

### UAT-002: No slide animation when deleting a photo

**Discovered:** 2026-01-27
**Resolved:** 2026-01-27
**Phase/Plan:** 04.1-01
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Delete animation / gap fill
**Description:** When a photo was deleted via the delete bar, the remaining thumbnails to the right did not animate/slide left to fill the gap. They snapped into position without animation.
**Root cause:** Array state update happened instantly without LayoutAnimation.
**Fix:** Added LayoutAnimation.configureNext before handleRemovePhoto state update
