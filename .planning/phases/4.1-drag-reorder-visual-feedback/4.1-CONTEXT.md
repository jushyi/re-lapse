# Phase 4.1: Drag-Reorder Visual Feedback - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-27
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When dragging a thumbnail to reorder, the other thumbnails should smoothly slide out of the way to show where the dragged item will land. It should feel like iOS home screen icon reordering — fluid and responsive, but smooth and precise rather than bouncy.

The animations should feel polished and professional. As you drag between photos, the surrounding thumbnails glide apart to make space. When you move away, that space smoothly collapses. The whole interaction feels alive and responsive without being playful or exaggerated.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Clear drop target** — It must always be obvious where the photo will land when released
- **Responsive movement** — Other thumbnails must react instantly as you drag, no lag or delay

Both are equally vital. The experience falls apart if either one is missing — you need responsive feedback AND clarity about where things will end up.

## What's Out of Scope

- Multi-select drag — Only one photo dragged at a time for this phase
- Any functionality changes to the existing drag system — this is purely visual/animation refinement

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Delete bar interaction should use the same smooth animation style — thumbnails fill the gap smoothly as item moves toward delete, maintaining consistency throughout the experience
- No bounce or overshoot in animations — smooth and precise settling into position

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This phase is a visual polish pass on the existing drag-to-reorder functionality from Phase 4. The core drag mechanics already work — this is about making it feel premium through animation quality.
