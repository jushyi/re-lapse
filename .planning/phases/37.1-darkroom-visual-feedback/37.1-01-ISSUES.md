## Resolved Issues

### UAT-001: Developing state gradient not purple-dominant

**Discovered:** 2026-01-27
**Resolved:** 2026-01-27
**Phase/Plan:** 37.1-01
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** Darkroom card button gradient (developing state)
**Description:** The gradient for developing photos shows a 50/50 split between purple and pink, rather than being purple-dominant as intended.
**Expected:** Purple tones should clearly dominate the gradient when photos are still developing
**Actual:** Purple and pink appear equally balanced (50/50 split)
**Resolution:** Implemented radial gradient with purple center (#7C3AED) fading to white edges, with 40% solid center stop

### UAT-002: Ready state gradient not distinguishable from developing

**Discovered:** 2026-01-27
**Resolved:** 2026-01-27
**Phase/Plan:** 37.1-01
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** Darkroom card button gradient (ready state)
**Description:** The ready state gradient shows only a slight difference from the developing state, making it hard to distinguish between the two states at a glance.
**Expected:** Pink tones should clearly dominate when photos are ready, creating obvious visual difference from developing state
**Actual:** Slight difference visible but hard to tell the states apart
**Resolution:** Implemented radial gradient with pink center (#DB2777) fading to white edges, clearly distinguishable from purple developing state
