<objective>
Fix 2 UAT issues from plan 37.1-01.

Source: 37.1-01-ISSUES.md
Priority: 0 critical, 0 major, 2 minor

Both issues relate to insufficient color differentiation between gradient states - the "developing" and "revealed" gradients look too similar because each uses only 2 color stops, creating a 50/50 split.

  <name>Fix UAT-001 & UAT-002: Center-out gradients with distinct primary colors</name>
  <files>src/constants/colors.js</files>
  <action>
Update the brand gradient colors to use center-dominant 3-stop gradients:

**Current problem:**

- `developing: ['#8B5CF6', '#EC4899']` - Purple-to-pink (50/50 split)
- `revealed: ['#A855F7', '#F472B6']` - Lighter purple-to-pink (still 50/50)

Both are essentially 2-stop gradients that look very similar.

**Fix approach:**
Use 3 color stops with PRIMARY color in CENTER (secondary → PRIMARY → secondary):

1. **developing** (purple center, fades to lighter edges):
   - Change to: `['#C084FC', '#7C3AED', '#C084FC']`
   - Edges: light purple (#C084FC - Tailwind purple-400)
   - Center: deep purple (#7C3AED - Tailwind violet-600)
   - Creates a glowing purple core effect

2. **revealed** (pink center, fades to lighter edges):
   - Change to: `['#F9A8D4', '#DB2777', '#F9A8D4']`
   - Edges: light pink (#F9A8D4 - Tailwind pink-300)
   - Center: deep pink (#DB2777 - Tailwind pink-600)
   - Creates a glowing pink core effect

This creates:

- Clear visual distinction between states
- Center-out "glow" effect with primary color dominating
- Purple core = "still developing", Pink core = "ready to reveal"
  </action>
  <verify>
  Run app, verify:

1. With developing photos: Card button shows purple core with lighter edges
2. With revealed photos: Card button shows pink core with lighter edges
3. The two states are clearly distinguishable at a glance
4. Gradient has a "center-out" glow appearance
   </verify>
   <done>Developing gradient has purple center glowing outward, revealed gradient has pink center glowing outward, and the two states are clearly distinguishable</done>
   </task>
   </tasks>

<verification>
Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] App builds without errors
- [ ] Developing state shows purple-dominant gradient
- [ ] Revealed state shows pink-dominant gradient
- [ ] The two states are clearly distinguishable at a glance
- [ ] Hold button gradient still works (uses revealed gradient)
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- UAT-001 fixed: Developing gradient is purple-dominant (not 50/50)
- UAT-002 fixed: Ready state is clearly distinguishable from developing state
- No visual regressions in other gradient usages
  </success_criteria>
