# Phase 8.1 Plan 01: Grid Header Safe Area Fix Summary

**Added safe area background coverage to AlbumGridScreen and header backgroundColor to AlbumPhotoPickerScreen, preventing photos from appearing behind iOS status bar when scrolling**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-29
- **Completed:** 2026-01-29
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Fixed AlbumGridScreen safe area gap with absolute positioned background View
- Fixed AlbumPhotoPickerScreen header with explicit backgroundColor
- Both screens now properly cover the iOS status bar area during scroll

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Fix AlbumGridScreen safe area coverage** - `b32c730` (fix)
2. **Task 2: Fix AlbumPhotoPickerScreen safe area coverage** - `ef076fa` (fix)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/screens/AlbumGridScreen.js` - Added safeAreaBackground View covering y=0 to y=insets.top
- `src/screens/AlbumPhotoPickerScreen.js` - Added backgroundColor to header style

## Decisions Made

1. **Additive approach for AlbumGridScreen** - Added separate safeAreaBackground View rather than changing existing header positioning logic. Simpler and less risky than restructuring.
2. **backgroundColor for AlbumPhotoPickerScreen** - Header already used paddingTop: insets.top extending to y=0, so adding backgroundColor was sufficient without needing additional elements.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness

Phase 8.1 complete, ready for Phase 9: Monthly Albums
