# Phase 36.1: Comment Sheet Fullscreen Expand - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When viewing comments on a photo, the user can swipe up on the comment sheet handle to smoothly expand the sheet to full screen — Instagram-style. The transition should feel buttery smooth with a natural, fluid animation.

When expanded, a mini photo thumbnail stays at the top providing context, with the comments list filling the rest of the screen below it. This gives maximum space for reading and scrolling through comments while maintaining visual context of which photo you're viewing.

Swiping down collapses the sheet back to its normal position. The whole interaction should feel effortless and natural.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Smooth gesture** - The swipe-up/down transition must feel buttery smooth, not janky
- **More comments visible** - Being able to see and scroll through many more comments in fullscreen
- **Easy to dismiss** - Getting back to normal view should be effortless — swipe down and done

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- New features in fullscreen mode — this is purely about the expand/collapse behavior, not adding functionality
- Keyboard handling changes — don't change how keyboard interacts with the expanded sheet
- The comment sheet already works for input and display; this phase just adds the fullscreen expansion

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Velocity-based snapping: fast swipes snap to full/collapsed, slow drags let you position the sheet
- Mini photo header when expanded (small thumbnail, not full photo)
- Standard Instagram-style expand/collapse behavior as the reference
