# Phase 13: Production Build & Branding - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-20
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The app is being rebranded to **Oly**. When someone downloads it and opens it for the first time, they should immediately feel the playful, fun energy — bright, friendly, approachable.

The app icon should be camera-inspired with an "O" integrated somewhere inside — the O could be a lens, a shutter aperture, or part of the camera body itself. It should feel like Oly at a glance.

The splash screen should have an animated reveal — something like a shutter opening that sets the tone for the darkroom/reveal concept right from launch. Not just a static logo, but a moment that feels intentional.

Everything should feel cohesive: the icon, the splash animation, and the existing dark in-app UI should all feel like they belong together. Playful energy within a dark, premium aesthetic.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Cohesive brand identity** — Icon, splash, and in-app feel must all connect and feel like "Oly"
- **Camera-inspired icon with O** — The icon needs to hint at photography while incorporating the Oly "O"
- **Animated splash reveal** — The launch experience should feel like a shutter opening, not just a static screen
- **Complement dark theme** — The branding should work with the existing black/dark UI

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- App Store public submission — TestFlight only for this phase
- Marketing materials — No screenshots, App Store descriptions, or promo assets
- In-app UI redesign — Branding is icon/splash only, screens stay as-is
- Multiple color themes — Sticking with dark theme

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- App name: **Oly** (rebranding from Lapse Clone)
- Icon direction: Camera-inspired shape with an "O" integrated (lens, aperture, camera body)
- Splash: Animated reveal (shutter opening concept)
- Color palette: Should complement existing dark theme
- Energy: Playful and fun, but premium

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

The existing dark UI is working well — the branding should enhance it, not fight against it. The playful energy should come through in the icon and splash animation while maintaining the sophisticated dark aesthetic throughout.

This is for TestFlight distribution to testers, not public App Store release.
