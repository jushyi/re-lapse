# Phase 29: Settings & Help Enhancements - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-05
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Minimal additions to the Settings screen — just two things: a way to contact support and a way to see what version of the app you're running. That's it.

When users tap Help/Support, it opens their email app with the support address pre-filled so they can write in. Simple, no external websites or complicated flows.

The version number sits at the very bottom of settings in a standard row format. Nothing fancy.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Help/Support link** - Opens email compose with support address pre-filled. Users need a clear way to reach out if something's wrong.
- **App version display** - Row format at the very bottom showing the current version number. Users should be able to find this easily.

## What's Out of Scope

- Notification preferences - Deferred to a future milestone focused on notifications
- Clear cache option - Not needed for now
- Any complex settings sections or groupings - Keep it minimal
- External support websites or FAQ pages - Just email for now

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Help/Support link placed near the bottom of Settings (above version)
- Version displayed in a row like other settings items, at the very bottom of the screen
- Match existing Settings styling - no special treatment, should look native to the current design

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This phase came from the Phase 24 Social Media Feature Audit (T2 gaps). The original audit suggested notification preferences, help link, app version, and clear cache. User has intentionally scoped this down to just help and version — notifications will be their own focused milestone later.
