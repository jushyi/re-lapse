# Phase 18.3: Triage Animation Z-Index & Delete Suction Effect - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-22
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

**Z-Index Fix:**
The triage button bar should always stay visually on top. When photo cards animate during triage (archive, journal, delete), they should move behind the buttons — never over them. The button bar remains dominant and accessible.

**Delete Suction Effect:**
When a photo is deleted, instead of falling straight down, the card gets "sucked into" the delete button like a vacuum. The card shrinks and accelerates toward the delete button position. It should feel satisfying — like the photo is being pulled in and consumed.

The suction animation should be a smooth pull (400-500ms) so users can actually see and appreciate the effect. The card moves and shrinks without rotation — clean and direct, not chaotic or spinning.

When the card reaches the delete button, the button gives a subtle pulse — a small scale animation that completes the interaction, like the button "swallowed" the card.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Z-index layering** — Cards must animate behind the button bar, never rendering over the buttons
- **Vacuum suction feel** — The delete animation must feel like being sucked in, with acceleration toward the button
- **Smooth timing** — 400-500ms duration so the effect is visible but not slow
- **Delete button pulse** — Subtle scale pulse when the card arrives, completing the interaction

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- Archive/Journal effects — Only delete gets the suction effect, archive and journal animations stay as-is
- Sound effects — No audio for the suction (that's Phase 18.3's domain)
- Card rotation/spin — Keep it clean, no spinning or tilting during the suction
- Clipping/masking at button edge — Simple z-index layering, not complex masking

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Vacuum-style pull: card shrinks and accelerates toward delete button
- No rotation during animation — straight shrink + move
- Smooth pull timing: 400-500ms (not too fast, not theatrical)
- Subtle pulse on delete button when card arrives
- Cards always behind button bar during all animations (archive, journal, delete)

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This phase addresses a visual bug (z-index) while adding polish (suction effect). Both are equally important — the bug fix ensures proper layering, and the suction effect makes delete feel more satisfying and intentional.

The vacuum metaphor fits the "delete" action well — photos being pulled in and consumed rather than just falling away.
