# Phase 24: Social Media Feature Audit - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A systematic feature checklist that goes through standard social media features and checks what's present or missing in the app. Compare against general social standards across major social apps (not tied to any single app like Instagram or Snapchat).

The audit should be organized by importance from the start, prioritizing features that users would expect from any social app and would notice if missing. This isn't deep UX analysis - it's a surface-level yes/no checklist asking "does this feature exist?"

The output is a prioritized gap list that automatically generates new phases for the roadmap. Missing features get turned into actionable phases, grouped logically.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Full coverage** - Audit all areas: social features, content, settings, notifications, privacy
- **User expectation focus** - Prioritize by what users would expect and notice if missing
- **Actionable output** - Gap list translates directly into new roadmap phases (expect 3-5 new phases)

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- Implementation work - audit only, no building during this phase
- Advanced features - skip complex stuff like live video, AR filters, stories editing
- Deep UX evaluation - surface level (exists or not), not quality assessment

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Compare against general social media standards (not a single app)
- Organize by importance tiers from the start
- Surface level depth: quick yes/no for each feature
- Missing features auto-generate as new roadmap phases
- Claude decides logical groupings for new phases

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

The app is considered mostly complete after 25 phases of development. This audit is validation that nothing obvious is missing, not a discovery phase expecting major gaps. Expect to find and generate only 3-5 new phases worth of work.
