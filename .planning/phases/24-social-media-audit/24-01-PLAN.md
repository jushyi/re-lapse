<objective>
Conduct systematic feature audit to verify social media app completeness and generate roadmap phases for gaps.

Purpose: Validate the app has all expected social media features before release, identify and prioritize missing functionality.
Output: Complete audit document (24-AUDIT.md) with verified feature checklist, gap analysis, and new roadmap phases for missing features.

**Vision from CONTEXT.md:**

- Systematic yes/no checklist for feature existence (not quality assessment)
- Organized by importance tiers (T1=Critical, T2=Expected, T3=Nice-to-have, T4=Advanced)
- Output generates 3-5 new roadmap phases for missing features

**Research provides:**

- Complete feature audit checklist with 15 categories and ~100 items
- Tier-based prioritization (T1-T4)
- Known present features from codebase exploration
- Likely missing features to verify

**Audit approach:**

- Surface level: YES/NO/PARTIAL for each feature
- Focus on T1 and T2 features (critical and expected)
- Group missing features into logical phases
- Skip T4 (advanced) features as out of scope for this app type

**Open issues that may surface:**

- ISS-001: Photo capture aspect ratio (Future)
- ISS-004: Comments sheet closes on profile navigation (Modal architecture)
- ISS-005: Swipe up gesture for comments (Enhancement)

  <files>.planning/phases/24-social-media-audit/24-AUDIT.md</files>
  <action>
Go through the feature checklist from 24-RESEARCH.md systematically. For each feature:

1. **Verify presence** by searching codebase (screens, services, components)
2. **Mark status**: ✅ Present | ❌ Missing | ⚠️ Partial
3. **Note location** for present features (file path)
4. **Note gap details** for missing/partial features

**Category order** (15 categories from research):

- Authentication & Account
- User Profile
- Friends & Social Connections
- Blocking & Safety
- Content Creation & Posting
- Content Viewing & Feed
- Stories Feature
- Reactions & Engagement
- Comments
- Albums & Organization
- Notifications
- Photo Management
- Settings
- Messaging (if applicable)
- Search & Discovery

**Tier focus:**

- T1 (Critical): MUST verify all - users notice immediately if missing
- T2 (Expected): MUST verify all - standard features users expect
- T3 (Nice-to-have): Quick check - note if missing but don't deep dive
- T4 (Advanced): Skip - out of scope for this app type

**Verification methods:**

- Grep for service functions
- Check screen existence
- Look for component implementations
- Verify navigation routes

Start audit document with header and begin verification. Document findings as you go.

  <name>Task 2: Gap Analysis & Roadmap Phase Generation</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/24-social-media-audit/24-AUDIT.md, .planning/ROADMAP.md</files>
  <action>
Analyze audit findings and generate new roadmap phases:

1. **Compile gaps by priority:**
   - T1 Missing = CRITICAL (must add immediately)
   - T2 Missing = EXPECTED (should add soon)
   - T3 Missing = BACKLOG (nice-to-have)

2. **Group related gaps into logical phases:**
   - Consider domain grouping (profile, social, content, settings)
   - Consider dependency order
   - Aim for 3-5 new phases (per CONTEXT.md guidance)
   - Combine small items, keep large items standalone

3. **Write phase specifications** for each new phase:
   - Goal description
   - Features included
   - Dependencies
   - Research indicator

4. **Update 24-AUDIT.md** with:
   - Gap analysis section
   - Recommended phases section
   - Priority recommendations

5. **Update ROADMAP.md** with new phases:
   - Add to Phases list (after Phase 25)
   - Add Phase Details sections
   - Update Progress table

Note: Phase 22 (Edit Profile) and Phase 23 (Photo Deletion) already planned - don't duplicate.
Check if existing planned phases cover any gaps (mark as "Covered by Phase XX").

<verify>

- 24-AUDIT.md has Gap Analysis and Recommended Phases sections
- ROADMAP.md has new phases added (if any beyond 22/23)
- All T1/T2 gaps have a resolution path (existing phase or new phase)

  <done>
- Gap analysis complete with all missing features categorized
- 3-5 new phases defined (or fewer if most gaps covered by Phase 22/23)
- ROADMAP.md updated with new phases and details

Before declaring phase complete:
- [ ] All T1 and T2 features verified with status
- [ ] All gaps have resolution path (existing or new phase)
- [ ] 24-AUDIT.md complete with checklist, gaps, and recommendations
- [ ] ROADMAP.md updated with any new phases
- [ ] No obvious T1/T2 features missed
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Systematic audit of all ~100 features from research checklist
- Clear ✅/❌/⚠️ status for each T1/T2 feature
- Gap analysis with priority grouping
- 3-5 new roadmap phases generated (or justification for fewer)
- ROADMAP.md updated with new phases
- Phase 24 complete
  </success_criteria>
