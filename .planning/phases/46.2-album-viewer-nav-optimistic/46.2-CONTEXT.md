# Phase 46.2: Album Viewer Nav Bar Optimistic Updates - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When swiping through photos in the full-screen album viewer, the bottom nav bar outline should move to the next photo as you're swiping — not wait until you've landed on it. Right now the outline jumps only after settling, which feels laggy and disconnected. It should feel immediate: as your finger moves toward the next photo, the outline follows, so the nav bar always reflects where you're going, not where you were.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **No delay or lag** — The outline must move instantly as you start swiping, zero perceptible wait
- **Correct position always** — The outline should never be on the wrong photo, even during fast swiping through multiple photos
- Both are equally important — no compromise on either instant response or accuracy

## What's Out of Scope

- No nav bar redesign — just fix the timing, don't change the nav bar's look or layout
- This is purely a behavior fix, not a visual overhaul

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard approaches for tracking swipe gestures and updating the nav outline optimistically.

## Additional Context

This is an INSERTED urgent phase (46.2) — a UX polish fix for the album grid full-screen viewer. The current behavior where the outline "jumps" after settling feels broken, not just unpolished. The fix should make it feel like the nav bar is connected to the swipe gesture in real-time.
