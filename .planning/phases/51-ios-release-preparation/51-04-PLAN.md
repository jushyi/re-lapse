<objective>
Choose and register a domain for Flick, set up a support email, and update all in-app support links and help pages.

Purpose: A real domain and support email are required for App Store submission (support URL field) and give the app a professional, legitimate presence.
Output: Domain registered, support email functional, in-app links updated.

**Current state:**

- SettingsScreen has hardcoded `support@rewind.app` email
- No domain currently registered
- Domain choice is TBD (from CONTEXT.md notes)
- App Store Connect requires a "Support URL" field

<tasks>

<task type="checkpoint:decision" gate="blocking">
  <decision>Choose a domain name for Flick</decision>
  <context>The app needs a domain for support email, App Store listing support URL, and potential future landing page. Should be memorable, available, and match the "Flick" brand. The domain will be used for: support@[domain] email, App Store support URL, and potentially a simple landing page later.</context>
  <options>
    <option id="flickphoto">
      <name>flickphoto.app</name>
      <pros>Clear purpose (photo app), .app is modern and HTTPS-enforced, "flick" + "photo" is descriptive</pros>
      <cons>.app domains are slightly more expensive (~$14/yr), "flickphoto" is two words</cons>
    </option>
    <option id="getflick">
      <name>getflick.app</name>
      <pros>Action-oriented ("get the app"), clean and short, works well as "getflick.app" URL</pros>
      <cons>"get" prefix is common/generic, may not be available</cons>
    </option>
    <option id="flickcamera">
      <name>flickcamera.app</name>
      <pros>Ties directly to the disposable camera concept, very descriptive</pros>
      <cons>Longer domain, "camera" may be too literal</cons>
    </option>
    <option id="custom">
      <name>Custom domain</name>
      <pros>You choose exactly what you want</pros>
      <cons>Need to check availability yourself</cons>
    </option>
  </options>
  <resume-signal>Select: flickphoto, getflick, flickcamera, or type your preferred domain</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <action>Register the chosen domain and set up email forwarding</action>
  <instructions>
    Based on the domain decision above:

    1. **Register the domain** at your preferred registrar (Namecheap, Google Domains, Cloudflare Registrar, etc.)
    2. **Set up email forwarding** so `support@[domain]` forwards to your personal email (maserinj@gmail.com or wherever you want reports/support to go)
       - Most registrars offer free email forwarding
       - Alternatively, use a service like ImprovMX (free tier) or Cloudflare Email Routing (free)
    3. **Optional:** Create a simple landing page or redirect the domain root to the App Store listing (can be done later)

    After completing, provide:
    - The registered domain
    - Confirm support@[domain] email is receiving mail (send a test email)

  </instructions>
  <verification>Send a test email to support@[domain] and confirm it arrives at your inbox</verification>
  <resume-signal>Type the registered domain and confirm email works, e.g.: "Domain: flickphoto.app, email forwarding confirmed"</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update in-app support links with real domain</name>
  <files>src/screens/SettingsScreen.js</files>
  <action>
Update the hardcoded support email in SettingsScreen.js:

- Change `'mailto:support@rewind.app?subject=Rewind%20Support%20Request'` to `'mailto:support@{CHOSEN_DOMAIN}?subject=Flick%20Support%20Request'`

Use the domain provided in the previous checkpoint.

Also verify no other files reference the old support email by grepping for `support@rewind` and `support@` across the codebase.
</action>
<verify>Run `grep -r "support@rewind\|support@" src/ --include="*.js"` returns only the updated reference</verify>
<done>SettingsScreen support email updated to real domain. No stale support references remain.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] Domain registered and accessible
- [ ] support@[domain] email forwarding works
- [ ] SettingsScreen.js has correct support email
- [ ] No stale "rewind.app" references in support links
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Domain registered for Flick
- Support email functional and forwarding to personal inbox
- In-app support link uses real domain and "Flick" branding
  </success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/51-ios-release-preparation/51-04-SUMMARY.md`

Record the chosen domain in the summary — it will be referenced by later plans (App Store Connect support URL, report email routing).
</output>
