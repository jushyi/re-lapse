<tasks>

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <action>Create App Store Connect listing and configure metadata</action>
  <instructions>
    Go to https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/ and complete the following:

    **1. Create New App:**
    - Click "+" → "New App"
    - Platform: iOS
    - Name: "Flick" (if taken, try "Flick - Photo Journal" or "Flick Camera")
    - Primary Language: English (US)
    - Bundle ID: com.spoodsjs.rewind (should already be registered)
    - SKU: flick-v1
    - User Access: Full Access

    **2. App Information:**
    - Privacy Policy URL: Host the privacy policy at your domain (e.g., https://[domain]/privacy) OR use a free hosting service. The content is in `src/constants/legalContent.js`.
    - Category: Photo & Video (primary), Social Networking (secondary)
    - Content Rights: Does not contain third-party content that requires rights
    - Age Rating: Complete the questionnaire (no violence, no gambling, infrequent/mild profanity since it's user-generated content, 12+ likely)

    **3. EU Digital Services Act:**
    - Go to App Information → scroll to "EU Digital Services Act"
    - Set trader status: Likely "Non-Trader" (individual developer, not a registered business)

    **4. Version Metadata (under iOS App → 1.0):**
    - Subtitle: "The disposable camera for your friend group"
    - Promotional Text: "Capture moments. Wait for the reveal. Share with friends."
    - Description:
      ```
      Flick brings back the magic of disposable cameras — but for your friend group.

      📸 Snap photos throughout your day
      🌗 Photos develop overnight in your darkroom
      ☀️ Wake up to a fresh batch of reveals every morning
      💬 React and comment on your friends' moments

      No filters. No followers. No pressure. Just real moments shared with the people who matter.

      Features:
      • Instant capture with a tap
      • Overnight darkroom developing
      • Morning reveal batches at 9am
      • Photo reactions and comments with GIFs
      • Friend-only sharing (no public profiles)
      • Custom albums and monthly archives
      • @mention friends in comments
      • Push notifications for reveals and social activity

      Flick is designed for close friends, not audiences. Your photos are shared only with people you've added as friends.
      ```
    - Keywords: disposable camera, photo sharing, friends, film camera, social, photo journal, darkroom, reveal, memories, private
    - Support URL: https://[your-domain] (from 51-04)
    - Marketing URL: (optional, can be same as support URL)
    - Version: 1.0.0
    - What's New: "First release! 📸"
    - Review Notes: "This is a friends-only photo sharing app. To test: create an account with any phone number (Firebase phone auth). The app requires at least 2 accounts to test social features (adding friends, seeing friend photos). The app uses a darkroom system — photos taken now are revealed the next morning at 9am."

    **5. App Privacy (Data Collection):**
    Navigate to App Privacy section and declare:
    - **Contact Info → Phone Number**: Collected, Linked to Identity, Used for App Functionality (authentication)
    - **Identifiers → User ID**: Collected, Linked to Identity, Used for App Functionality
    - **Identifiers → Device ID**: Collected, Not Linked to Identity, Used for Analytics (Firebase)
    - **Usage Data → Product Interaction**: Collected, Not Linked to Identity, Used for Analytics (Firebase Perf)
    - **Diagnostics → Performance Data**: Collected, Not Linked to Identity, Used for Analytics (Firebase Perf)
    - **Contacts → Contacts**: Collected, Not Linked to Identity, Used for App Functionality (friend suggestions — only if user grants permission)
    - **Photos or Videos → Photos**: Collected, Linked to Identity, Used for App Functionality (the core feature)
    - **Purchases → Purchase History**: Collected, Linked to Identity, Used for App Functionality (contributions)

    **6. IAP Products:**
    Navigate to Features → In-App Purchases → "+"
    Create 4 Non-Consumable products:
    - Product ID: `flick_contribution_099`, Reference Name: "Coffee Contribution", Price: $0.99
    - Product ID: `flick_contribution_299`, Reference Name: "Lights On Contribution", Price: $2.99
    - Product ID: `flick_contribution_499`, Reference Name: "New Features Contribution", Price: $4.99
    - Product ID: `flick_contribution_999`, Reference Name: "Champion Contribution", Price: $9.99

    For each product:
    - Display Name: "Support Flick" (or similar)
    - Description: "One-time contribution to support Flick development. Unlocks custom name color."
    - Review Screenshot: (can add later, or use a screenshot of the contributions page)

    **7. Note the Apple ID:**
    After creating the app, go to App Information → General Information → Apple ID. Copy this number — it's needed for eas.json's `ascAppId`.

    Provide:
    - The Apple ID (number) from App Store Connect
    - Confirm app listing created
    - Confirm IAP products created
    - Note if app name "Flick" was available or what alternative was used

  </instructions>
  <verification>App listing visible in App Store Connect with status "Prepare for Submission"</verification>
  <resume-signal>Provide the Apple ID number and confirm all metadata, privacy declarations, and IAP products are configured</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update eas.json with App Store Connect Apple ID</name>
  <files>eas.json</files>
  <action>
Update `eas.json` submit profile with the ascAppId provided in the checkpoint:

Replace the placeholder:

```json
"submit": {
  "production": {
    "ios": {
      "ascAppId": "PLACEHOLDER_SET_AFTER_ASC_SETUP"
    }
  }
}
```

With the actual Apple ID number from App Store Connect.
</action>
<verify>Run `cat eas.json | grep ascAppId` shows the real Apple ID (a numeric string, not "PLACEHOLDER")</verify>
<done>eas.json submit profile configured with real App Store Connect Apple ID.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Capture and prepare App Store screenshots</name>
  <files>assets/screenshots/ (new directory)</files>
  <action>
Capture screenshots for the App Store listing. Need 6.9" iPhone screenshots (1320 x 2868 pixels — iPhone 16 Pro Max / iPhone 15 Pro Max size).

Capture 5-8 screenshots covering the core flow:

1. **Camera screen** — the capture experience
2. **Darkroom** — photos developing, countdown timer
3. **Feed** — revealed photos with friend names
4. **Photo detail** — full photo with reactions
5. **Comments** — comment section with reactions and GIFs
6. **Profile** — user profile with albums and Selects
7. **Stories** — story viewer (if visually compelling)
8. **Contributions** — support page (optional, shows polish)

Use the iOS Simulator at iPhone 16 Pro Max resolution. Take screenshots using Cmd+S in Simulator.

Save raw screenshots to `assets/screenshots/` directory.

For device framing and captions, create a simple description file `assets/screenshots/CAPTIONS.md`:

```markdown
# App Store Screenshots

1. camera.png — "Capture the moment"
2. darkroom.png — "Wait for the reveal"
3. feed.png — "See what your friends captured"
4. detail.png — "React and connect"
5. comments.png — "Share your thoughts"
6. profile.png — "Your photo journal"
```

Note: Device framing (phone bezels around screenshots) can be done with free tools like Screenshots Pro, MockUPhone, or Apple's own marketing resources. The actual framing is a manual step for App Store Connect upload.
</action>
<verify>Directory `assets/screenshots/` exists with screenshot files. `CAPTIONS.md` lists all screenshots with captions.</verify>
<done>App Store screenshots captured at 6.9" resolution with caption descriptions ready for upload.</done>
</task>
