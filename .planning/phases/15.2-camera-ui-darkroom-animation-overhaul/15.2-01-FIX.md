<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Fix UAT-001: Reduce footer height from ~1/3 to ~1/4 screen</name>
  <files>src/screens/CameraScreen.js</files>
  <action>
1. Reduce FOOTER_HEIGHT constant from 280px to approximately 200-210px (~1/4 of screen height)
2. Recalculate CAMERA_HEIGHT based on new smaller footer size (will be taller)
3. Ensure all footer content still fits within the reduced height

This is a simple constant adjustment. The footer should still contain all controls but take up less vertical space.
  </action>
  <verify>App runs, footer visually covers ~1/4 of screen instead of ~1/3</verify>
  <done>Footer height reduced to approximately 1/4 of screen</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Fix UAT-002: Reposition flash/flip buttons above footer</name>
  <files>src/screens/CameraScreen.js</files>
  <action>
1. Move flash and flip buttons OUT of the footer and position them as floating controls above the footer
2. Position them 5-10px above the footer edge, overlaying the bottom of the camera preview
3. Reduce button size by 10% from current size (make them slightly smaller)
4. Maintain circular styling (borderRadius = width/2)
5. Position: flash button on far left, flip button on far right, both at same vertical position
6. Use absolute positioning with bottom value calculated relative to footer top

The buttons should appear to "float" over the camera preview, just above where the footer begins.
  </action>
  <verify>App runs, flash/flip buttons float 5-10px above footer over camera preview, buttons are smaller</verify>
  <done>Flash/flip buttons repositioned to float above footer with reduced size</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Fix UAT-003: Remove black outline from camera preview</name>
  <files>src/screens/CameraScreen.js</files>
  <action>
1. Find the wrapper View with overflow: 'hidden' that clips the camera preview for rounded corners
2. Remove any borderWidth, borderColor, or border-related styles
3. If the outline is from the View wrapper, try setting borderWidth: 0 explicitly
4. Check if the outline is from the CameraView itself and adjust accordingly
5. Ensure the wrapper View has matching backgroundColor to blend edges (match #000 or transparent)

Common causes of unwanted outlines:
- Default border on wrapper View
- backgroundColor mismatch between wrapper and surrounding content
- Border from StyleSheet default

Goal: Rounded corners with seamless transition to surrounding content, no visible border/outline.
  </action>
  <verify>App runs, camera preview has rounded corners with no visible black outline</verify>
  <done>Camera preview rounded corners display cleanly without outline</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Fix UAT-004: Reposition and restyle zoom bar</name>
  <files>src/screens/CameraScreen.js</files>
  <action>
1. **Position:** Move zoom bar OUT of footer, float it above camera preview at same height as flash/flip buttons
   - Horizontally center the zoom bar
   - Vertically align with flash/flip buttons (5-10px above footer)
   - Use absolute positioning

2. **Zoom options:** Reduce from 4 to 3 options
   - Remove 2x zoom level
   - Keep only: 0.5, 1, 3
   - Update zoom levels array accordingly
   - Adjust zoom mapping for remaining levels

3. **Label styling:**
   - Selected zoom level shows 'x' suffix (e.g., "1x")
   - Unselected levels show number only (e.g., ".5", "3")
   - The 'x' should be vertically centered with the number (use alignItems: 'center' or baseline alignment)
   - Conditional rendering: only add 'x' to the active/selected level

Layout: [Flash] --------- [.5 | 1x | 3] --------- [Flip]
All three controls (flash, zoom bar, flip) on same horizontal line, floating above footer.
  </action>
  <verify>App runs, zoom bar floats above camera (same level as flash/flip), shows .5/1/3 options, 'x' only on selected level</verify>
  <done>Zoom bar repositioned and restyled: floats above footer, 3 options, 'x' suffix on selected level only</done>
</task>
