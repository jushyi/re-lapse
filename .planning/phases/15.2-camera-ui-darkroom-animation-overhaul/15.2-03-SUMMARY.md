# Phase 15.2 Plan 03: Capture Animation Change Summary

**Verified existing card fan animation provides superior capture feedback - no code changes needed**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-21T19:38:35Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-21T19:39:51Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (2 verification, 1 checkpoint)
- **Files modified:** 0

## Accomplishments

- Verified flying photo animation was already removed (not present in codebase)
- Confirmed card capture animation (`playCardCaptureAnimation`) provides enhanced feedback:
  - Scale animation: 1.0 → 1.2 → 1.0 (120ms expand, 100ms return)
  - Fan spread animation: cards fan out and rise during capture
  - Parallel animations for satisfying visual effect
- Confirmed haptic feedback triggers on capture (`lightImpact()`)
- Confirmed flash effect fires immediately on shutter press
- Human verification approved - capture feels snappy and responsive

## Task Commits

No code changes required - plan requirements were already implemented in 15.2-02:

1. **Task 1: Remove flying photo animation** - Already complete (not in codebase)
2. **Task 2: Enhance card bounce animation** - Already complete via `playCardCaptureAnimation`
3. **Task 3: Human verification** - Approved

**Plan metadata:** (this commit)

## Files Created/Modified

None - all requirements were already implemented in prior plans.

## Decisions Made

- **Keep existing card fan animation:** The current `playCardCaptureAnimation` implementation provides better visual feedback than the plan's simple bounce animation. It fans cards out while scaling, giving a satisfying "receiving photo" effect.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written (verification passed).

Note: The plan was written expecting code that needed to be removed/modified, but the current codebase already had the desired behavior implemented in 15.2-02.

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 15.2 complete - all 3 plans executed
- Camera capture animation provides instant, responsive feedback
- Ready for Phase 15.3 (True 0.5x Ultra-Wide Zoom)
