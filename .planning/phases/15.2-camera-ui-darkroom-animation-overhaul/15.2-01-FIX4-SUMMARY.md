# Phase 15.2-01-FIX4: Zoom Level Simplification Summary

**Removed 0.5x zoom (expo-camera limitation), simplified to 1x/2x/3x with proper mappings**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-21T19:00:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-21T19:08:00Z
- **Tasks:** 1 (with iterative refinement based on UAT feedback)
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Removed 0.5x zoom option (expo-camera can't access ultra-wide lens, caused confusion)
- Added 2x zoom level for better control between 1x and 3x
- Final mappings: 1x=0 (baseline), 2x=0.17 (moderate), 3x=0.33 (telephoto)
- Zoom bar now shows three clear, distinct zoom levels

## Task Commits

1. **Initial restore** - `6bb2c27` (fix) - Restored 15.2-01 values
2. **Tune 1x** - `8566c83` (fix) - Reduced 1x from 0.17 to 0.08
3. **Remove 0.5x** - `182c618` (fix) - Simplified to 1x and 3x
4. **Add 2x** - `004320f` (feat) - Added middle zoom option

**Plan metadata:** TBD (docs: complete plan)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/screens/CameraScreen.js` - ZOOM_LEVELS simplified from 0.5x/1x/3x to 1x/2x/3x

## Decisions Made

- Removed 0.5x because expo-camera's zoom property can't go below 0 (baseline), so ultra-wide requires different API
- Added 2x zoom (0.17) as middle option per user request
- 1x set to 0 (true baseline) for natural feel

## Deviations from Plan

Iterative refinement based on live UAT feedback instead of single fix.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## Next Phase Readiness

- All zoom levels working as originally designed
- Ready for re-verification and phase 15.2-02
