# Phase 15.2-01-FIX3: Camera Button Centering, Icon, Zoom, and Haptics Summary

**Fixed 3 UAT issues plus 1 enhancement: capture button centering, flip icon redesign, zoom level correction, and haptic feedback on all buttons**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-21T18:00:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-21T18:03:00Z
- **Tasks:** 4
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Capture button now visually centered in footer (balanced with invisible spacer)
- Flip camera icon replaced with clean rotation arrows design
- Zoom levels corrected: 1x = no zoom (was wrongly 0.17), 3x = moderate (0.25, was too high at 0.5)
- Haptic feedback added to flash, capture, and flip buttons (zoom already had it)

## Task Commits

1. **All 4 tasks** - `f51dfd6` (fix) - Combined commit for all fixes

**Plan metadata:** TBD (docs: complete plan)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/screens/CameraScreen.js` - Added footerSpacer style and View, replaced FlipCameraIcon SVG, fixed ZOOM_LEVELS mapping, added lightImpact() calls

## Decisions Made

- **Spacer approach for centering:** Adding an invisible 50px spacer on the right side of footer controls creates balanced layout: [darkroom 50px] [gap 24] [capture 100px] [gap 24] [spacer 50px]. This is simpler and more maintainable than absolute positioning.
- **Rotation arrows icon:** Standard two-arrows-forming-circle pattern (like refresh icon) is cleaner than camera-body-with-internal-arrows. Matches common iOS flip/rotate conventions.
- **Zoom correction:** expo-camera zoom 0 = 1x baseline (no zoom). Previous mapping of 1x=0.17 was incorrect and made the "normal" view appear zoomed in.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Camera UI footer is polished and ready for UAT re-verification
- All buttons provide haptic feedback
- Ready for 15.2-02 (Darkroom button card stack) after verification
