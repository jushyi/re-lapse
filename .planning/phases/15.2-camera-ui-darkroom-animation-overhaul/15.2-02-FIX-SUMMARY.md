# 15.2-02-FIX Summary

## Overview
Fixed 1 UAT issue (UAT-001) with 3 sub-items from plan 15.2-02 (darkroom card stack button).

## Issues Fixed

### UAT-001: Card Stack Button Visual Polish (3 sub-items)

#### 1. Card Stack Button Size
**Problem:** Button was too small relative to capture button
**Solution:** Increased card dimensions to ~95% of capture button
- `CARD_WIDTH`: 50 → 63
- `CARD_HEIGHT`: 66 → 84
- Container width: +16 → +20 for fanning room

#### 2. Card Stack Button Centering
**Problem:** Button was too close to capture button
**Solution:** Changed footer layout to space-between
- `justifyContent`: 'center' → 'space-between'
- `paddingHorizontal`: 16 → 40
- Added `width: '100%'` for proper spacing
- Removed `gap: 24`

#### 3. Capture Animation Speed
**Problem:** Animation lingered too long before snapping back
**Solution:** Changed from spring to timing animations
- Expand: 120ms timing (was slow spring)
- Snap back: 100ms timing (immediate return)
- Total animation: ~220ms (snappy feel)

### Additional Refinement: Card Fanning Direction
**Problem:** Cards fanned right, making stack look off-center with multiple cards
**Solution:** Implemented center-compensated fanning
- Back cards still fan right
- Top card leans left to compensate
- Stack stays visually centered regardless of card count
- Final values: 6° rotation, 5px offset per card

## Files Modified
- `src/screens/CameraScreen.js`

## Verification
- [x] Card stack button is ~95% of capture button size
- [x] Card stack button properly centered in footer
- [x] Animation snaps back immediately (no lingering)
- [x] Card fanning keeps stack visually centered
- [x] Human verification approved

## Status
**COMPLETE** - All UAT-001 sub-items addressed and approved.
