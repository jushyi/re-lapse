### UAT-001: Card stack button size and positioning needs adjustment

**Discovered:** 2026-01-21
**Phase/Plan:** 15.2-02
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** Darkroom card stack button
**Description:** Three related visual polish items:
1. Card stack size feels too small - should be approximately 95% the size of the capture button
2. Button not properly centered between left edge and capture button - currently too close to the capture button
3. Capture animation (fan-out + scale) should be ~1.25x faster
**Expected:** Button should be larger, properly centered in its space, with snappier animation
**Actual:** Button feels undersized, positioned too close to capture button, animation slightly too slow
**Repro:**
1. Open camera screen
2. Observe card stack button on left side of footer
3. Compare size to capture button (should be ~95% of capture button size)
4. Note position relative to left edge vs capture button
5. Capture a photo and observe animation speed
