### UAT-001: 0.5x zoom shows same view as 1x

**Discovered:** 2026-01-21
**Phase/Plan:** 15.2-01-FIX3
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** Zoom levels
**Description:** When tapping 0.5x on the zoom bar, the camera view appears the same as 1x - there's no visible difference/wider angle.
**Expected:** 0.5x should show a wider angle view than 1x
**Actual:** 0.5x and 1x show identical camera view
**Repro:**
1. Open camera screen
2. Tap 1x on zoom bar, note the view
3. Tap 0.5x on zoom bar
4. View appears the same as 1x

**Resolved:** 2026-01-21 - Fixed in 15.2-01-FIX4
**Commits:** 6bb2c27, 8566c83, 182c618, 004320f
**Fix:** Removed 0.5x (expo-camera can't access ultra-wide lens), simplified to 1x/2x/3x with proper mappings (1x=0, 2x=0.17, 3x=0.33).
