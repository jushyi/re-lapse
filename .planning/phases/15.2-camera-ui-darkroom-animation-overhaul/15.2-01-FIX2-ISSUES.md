## Open Issues

### UAT-001: Capture button off-center (shifted right)

**Discovered:** 2026-01-21
**Phase/Plan:** 15.2-01-FIX2
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** Camera footer layout
**Description:** The capture button is not properly centered in the footer - it appears shifted to the right of center.
**Expected:** Capture button should be horizontally centered in the footer
**Actual:** Capture button is visibly off to the right
**Repro:** Open Camera screen, observe capture button position

### UAT-002: Flip camera icon looks janky

**Discovered:** 2026-01-21
**Phase/Plan:** 15.2-01-FIX2
**Severity:** Cosmetic
**Feature:** Flip camera button
**Description:** The flip camera button icon (camera frame with arrow) looks "janky" - the arrow inside the camera frame icon doesn't look right.
**Expected:** Clean, professional camera flip icon
**Actual:** Arrow portion of icon looks misshapen/poorly designed
**Repro:** Open Camera screen, look at flip camera button in floating controls

### UAT-003: Zoom levels don't match actual zoom

**Discovered:** 2026-01-21
**Phase/Plan:** 15.2-01-FIX2
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Zoom control bar
**Description:** The zoom levels displayed (.5, 1, 3) don't correspond to the actual camera zoom. 0.5x looks like 1x, 1x looks too zoomed in, and 3x feels almost like 5x.
**Expected:** .5x = wide angle, 1x = normal, 3x = 3x optical zoom
**Actual:** Zoom values are incorrectly mapped - all appear more zoomed than labeled
**Repro:**
1. Open Camera screen
2. Tap .5 zoom - should be widest but looks like normal 1x
3. Tap 1 zoom - appears more zoomed than normal
4. Tap 3 zoom - appears far more zoomed than 3x should be
