## Files Created/Modified

- `src/screens/CameraScreen.js` - Complete UI overhaul: footer expansion, capture button ring, circular buttons, camera preview wrapper, zoom control bar

## Decisions Made

- Zoom levels mapped to expo-camera range: 0.5x=0, 1x=0.17, 2x=0.33, 3x=0.5
- Removed debug darkroom button (🌙) - no longer needed for development
- Flash/flip buttons moved from floating overlay to footer for cleaner layout
- Camera preview rounded via wrapper View with overflow:hidden (CameraView doesn't support borderRadius directly)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Camera footer redesign complete
- Ready for Plan 02: Darkroom button card stack redesign and capture animation change
