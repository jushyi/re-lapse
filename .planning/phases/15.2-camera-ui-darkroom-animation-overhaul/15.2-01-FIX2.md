<task type="auto">
  <name>Fix UAT-001: Camera preview doesn't extend to screen edges</name>
  <files>src/screens/CameraScreen.js</files>
  <action>
Remove the margin around the camera preview so it extends edge-to-edge.

Current state:
- cameraContainer has top/left/right set to CAMERA_PREVIEW_MARGIN (16px)
- This creates a black border between the preview and screen edges

Fix:
1. Change cameraContainer position from using CAMERA_PREVIEW_MARGIN to 0 for left/right
2. Keep top: 0 so preview starts at top of screen
3. Update height calculation to use full CAMERA_HEIGHT
4. Maintain the rounded corners at the BOTTOM of the camera preview (where it meets the floating controls)
5. Remove top rounding - camera should go edge-to-edge at top

The visual effect should be: camera fills entire width, has rounded corners only at bottom near footer.
  </action>
  <verify>App runs, camera preview extends to screen edges with no black border on sides</verify>
  <done>Camera preview fills full width with rounded bottom corners only</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Fix UAT-002: Footer background color is gray instead of black</name>
  <files>src/screens/CameraScreen.js</files>
  <action>
Change the footer background color from gray (#1A1A1A) to pure black (#000000) to match the navigation bar.

Current state:
- footerBar backgroundColor is '#1A1A1A' (dark gray)

Fix:
1. Change footerBar backgroundColor from '#1A1A1A' to '#000000'

This makes the footer seamlessly blend with the nav bar below.
  </action>
  <verify>App runs, footer background is black matching the nav bar</verify>
  <done>Footer background is pure black (#000000)</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Fix UAT-003: Remove gray circle placeholder from footer</name>
  <files>src/screens/CameraScreen.js</files>
  <action>
Remove the gray circle spacer that was left behind when the debug button was removed. The footer should only show Darkroom button (left of center) and Capture button (center), with no placeholder on the right.

Current state:
- footerControls has 3 elements: DarkroomButton, CaptureButton, and a spacer View with circleButton style
- The spacer creates a visible gray circle on the right

Fix:
1. Remove the spacer View with circleButton style from footerControls
2. Adjust the footerControls layout to center the Darkroom + Capture buttons properly
3. Use flexbox to center the content without needing a right spacer
   - Option: Use justifyContent: 'center' with proper spacing between darkroom and capture

The result should be: Darkroom button to the left of center, Capture button centered, nothing on right side.
  </action>
  <verify>App runs, no gray circle visible on right side of footer, buttons remain properly positioned</verify>
  <done>Gray circle removed, footer shows only Darkroom and Capture buttons centered</done>
</task>
