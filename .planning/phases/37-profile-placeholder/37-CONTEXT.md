# Phase 37: Profile Placeholder - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The Profile tab is a minimal placeholder until the full Profile redesign in a future milestone. Right now it just needs to give users access to their friends list and a way to sign out. Nothing else.

This is intentionally bare-bones — the real Profile work comes later.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Friends button** - Navigate to friends list
- **Logout button** - Ability to sign out

That's it. Two things.

## What's Out of Scope

- Profile editing (name, bio, profile photo) - future milestone
- User stats/metrics display (photo counts, friend counts, reactions) - future milestone
- Settings/preferences screen - not needed yet
- Any polish or visual design work - this is a placeholder

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements - open to standard approaches. Whatever makes sense for a minimal placeholder.

## Additional Context

The current ProfileScreen.js already exists with some features. This phase is about stripping it down to the essentials, not building from scratch.
