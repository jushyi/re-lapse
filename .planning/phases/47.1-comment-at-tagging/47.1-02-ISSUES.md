## Open Issues

### UAT-003: Reply autocomplete text replacement corrupts input

**Discovered:** 2026-02-11
**Phase/Plan:** 47.1-02
**Severity:** Major (upgraded from Minor)
**Feature:** Reply @-mention autocomplete
**Description:** When composing a reply and using @-autocomplete, selecting a suggestion replaces the wrong @ (the auto-inserted reply @mention) instead of the one being typed. The replaced username gets repositioned after a space, and the cursor ends up at the wrong position.
**Expected:** Selecting a suggestion should cleanly replace the `@query` being typed with `@username` — leaving the auto-inserted reply @mention intact
**Actual:** The auto-inserted reply @mention gets replaced. The selected username is mispositioned with extra spacing. Text input is corrupted.
**Fix attempt:** 47.1-02-FIX Task 1 (prevTextLengthRef cursor adjustment) — changed behavior but did NOT resolve. Now corrupts text differently (replaces wrong @mention).
**Repro:**

1. Open comments on a photo
2. Tap "Reply" on an existing comment
3. After the auto-inserted @mention, type some text then `@a` (or any `@` + letter)
4. Select a suggestion from the overlay
5. Observe: the auto-inserted reply @mention is replaced instead of the typed one; text is corrupted

## Resolved Issues

### UAT-001: @-trigger requires extra character before overlay appears

**Discovered:** 2026-02-11
**Resolved:** 2026-02-11 — Fixed in 47.1-02-FIX Task 1
**Commit:** aae3026
**Severity:** Minor
**Description:** Typing `@` alone did not show the suggestion overlay. Now shows immediately.

### UAT-002: @mention profile navigation renders behind current view

**Discovered:** 2026-02-11
**Deferred:** 2026-02-11 — Regression from Phase 46.1 (OtherUserProfile card vs fullScreenModal). Affects ALL profile navigation from PhotoDetail, not just @mentions.
**Severity:** Major
**Description:** Tapping an @mention (or avatar) in comments causes the profile to render behind the transparentModal PhotoDetail. Root cause is navigation stack layering: transparentModal always renders above card screens.
