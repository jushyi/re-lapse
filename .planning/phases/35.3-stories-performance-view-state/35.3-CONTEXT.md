# Phase 35.3: Stories Performance & View State Fix - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Stories should feel exactly like Instagram — instant, smooth, and responsive. When you tap into someone's stories, photos should load immediately with no visible pause or spinner. Swiping between photos should be fluid, not jerky.

The view state ring around story cards should accurately reflect what you've actually seen. Right now, it turns gray after viewing just one photo, even if that friend has multiple stories. It should only turn gray once you've seen ALL their photos.

If you close out of stories before viewing everything, tapping back in should resume from where you left off — taking you to the next unviewed story, not back to the beginning.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Accurate view tracking** — Ring only goes gray when ALL photos from that friend have been viewed
- **Fast photo loading** — Eliminate the noticeable delay before photos appear
- **Smooth transitions** — Overall navigation should feel polished, not clunky
- **Resume position** — Closing and reopening stories picks up from next unviewed photo

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- No new story features — this is purely fixing what's broken
- Keep current visual design — just fix performance and behavior
- Not adding new UI elements or redesigning the stories experience

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Should feel exactly like Instagram stories — that's the reference point
- Implies preloading adjacent photos so next/previous are ready immediately
- The current issues:
  - Noticeable delay/pause before each photo appears when navigating
  - Ring turns gray after viewing just ONE photo, even when there are more

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This is a fix phase, not a feature phase. The stories feature was implemented in previous phases but the performance and view state tracking have issues that make it feel unpolished. The goal is to bring it up to Instagram-quality feel.
