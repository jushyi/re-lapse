## Open Issues

### UAT-001: Segmented progress line disappears with many stories

**Discovered:** 2026-01-26
**Phase/Plan:** 35.4-01
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Story progress segments
**Description:** When a friend has many photos in their story, the segmented progress line at the top of the story modal disappears entirely.
**Expected:** Progress segments should remain visible and shrink proportionally to fit all photos
**Actual:** Progress line disappears entirely when photo count is high
**Repro:**

1. Find a friend with many journaled photos (10+)
2. Open their story
3. Look at progress segments at top - they are missing

### UAT-002: Resume position inconsistent between users

**Discovered:** 2026-01-26
**Phase/Plan:** 35.4-01
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Resume position tracking
**Description:** Resume position works correctly for some friends but not others. Inconsistent behavior across different friend stories.
**Expected:** Resume should work consistently for all friends - always start at first unviewed photo
**Actual:** Works for some users, fails for others (starts from beginning or wrong position)
**Repro:**

1. Partially view stories from multiple friends
2. Close modal for each
3. Reopen each friend's story
4. Compare - some resume correctly, others don't

### UAT-003: Rapid tapping performance not smooth

**Discovered:** 2026-01-26
**Phase/Plan:** 35.4-01
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** Story navigation
**Description:** Rapid tapping to advance through stories doesn't feel as smooth as Instagram. Performance lag or stutter when tapping quickly.
**Expected:** Instant, fluid response to rapid taps like Instagram stories
**Actual:** Some lag or stutter during rapid tapping
**Repro:**

1. Open a friend's story with multiple photos
2. Tap rapidly on the right side to advance
3. Note the responsiveness vs Instagram
