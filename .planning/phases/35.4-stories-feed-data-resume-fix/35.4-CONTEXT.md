# Phase 35.4: Stories Feed Data & Resume Fix - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When the stories experience is working correctly, it should feel seamless and intuitive. Opening the stories row shows all friends who have journaled photos - no missing content. When a friend journals something new, their story jumps to the front of the row so I always see fresh content first.

Within each story, photos play through in the order they were captured - oldest to newest, like flipping through a timeline of their day. If I close a story partway through, reopening it jumps me directly back to where I was. No starting over, no hunting for where I left off.

The resume only resets once I've seen everything - then next time I open that story, it starts fresh from the beginning.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Story ordering makes sense** - When a friend journals new content, their story jumps to the front of the row. Fresh content is always visible first.
- **Photos in capture order** - Within a story, photos appear oldest to newest so you're scrolling forward through their timeline.
- **Resume jumps directly** - Open a story → land exactly on the photo where you left off, no intermediate steps.

## What's Out of Scope

- No UI changes - existing story card design and modal appearance stay the same
- No performance work - Phase 35.3 already handled story loading performance
- No new features - this is purely fixing data issues and ordering logic
- Pure bug fix phase focused on data correctness

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Resume position persists until all photos in that story are viewed, then resets
- Jump directly to resume position on open (no "start from beginning" behavior)
- Story row reorders whenever any friend journals new content (their story moves to front)
- Missing photos need investigation - not sure of exact pattern yet

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This phase addresses three related issues noticed after Phase 35.3:

1. Stories not showing all journaled photos from friends
2. Story ordering incorrect (newly journaled inserted in middle instead of jumping to front)
3. Resume tracking not working as expected

The user prioritized ordering as most critical. The missing photos bug pattern is unknown - will need investigation during planning.
