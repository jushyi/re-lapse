# Phase 18.4 Plan 01: Triage Animation Arc Adjustment Summary

**Exponential power curve for Journal/Archive arc path with 800ms duration - cards start flat, accelerate downward as they exit**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-23T14:30:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-23T14:38:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (2 auto + 1 checkpoint)
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Replaced linear arc formula (`y = 0.4 * |x|`) with exponential power curve (`y = maxY * x^2.5`)
- Arc now starts flat/horizontal and steepens as card accelerates off screen
- Preserved original linear rotation formula for natural tilt feel
- Slowed swipe duration from 400ms to 800ms for better arc visibility

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Exponential arc curve** - `781519c` (feat)
2. **Fix: Linear rotation + 533ms** - `ffb0ffe` (fix)
3. **Fix: 800ms duration** - `2e494d1` (fix)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/SwipeablePhotoCard.js` - Updated arc formula to power curve, kept linear rotation, increased EXIT_DURATION to 800ms

## Decisions Made

- **Power curve exponent 2.5:** Creates gradual start that accelerates - at 50% exit, arc is only 18% of final Y position
- **Linear rotation preserved:** User preferred original tilt feel; exponential rotation felt unnatural
- **800ms duration:** Slowed from 400ms to allow exponential curve to be visible and feel smooth

## Deviations from Plan

### User-Requested Adjustments

**1. Rotation kept linear instead of exponential**
- **Found during:** Checkpoint verification
- **Issue:** User felt exponential rotation made animation feel unnatural
- **Fix:** Reverted to original `translateX.value / 15` formula
- **Committed in:** ffb0ffe

**2. Animation speed slowed to 800ms**
- **Found during:** Checkpoint verification
- **Issue:** User felt 400ms was too quick, then 533ms still not slow enough
- **Fix:** Increased EXIT_DURATION to 800ms
- **Committed in:** 2e494d1

---

**Total deviations:** 2 user-requested adjustments
**Impact on plan:** Improved animation feel based on user feedback. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 18.4 complete
- Ready for Phase 18.5: Camera Default Launch Screen
