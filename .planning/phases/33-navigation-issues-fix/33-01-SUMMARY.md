# Phase 33 Plan 01: Navigation Issues Fix Summary

**Converted comments bottom sheet from Modal to Animated.View and added swipe-up gesture for intuitive comment access**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-06T13:39:24Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-06T13:43:49Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments

- Comments sheet now persists when navigating to commenter profiles (ISS-004 fixed)
- Swipe-up on photo opens comments sheet as alternative to tap (ISS-005 fixed)
- Backdrop fade animation provides smooth visual transition
- Haptic feedback on swipe-up gesture for tactile confirmation

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Convert CommentsBottomSheet from Modal to Animated.View** - `2c785a6` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Add swipe-up gesture to open comments** - `97651e5` (feat)
3. **Fix: Disable swipe-to-dismiss when comments open** - `99e0811` (fix)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/comments/CommentsBottomSheet.js` - Replaced Modal with Animated.View, added backdropOpacity animation
- `src/styles/CommentsBottomSheet.styles.js` - Added animatedOverlay style with absolute positioning and zIndex
- `src/hooks/usePhotoDetailModal.js` - Added onSwipeUp callback and upward swipe detection to panResponder
- `src/screens/PhotoDetailScreen.js` - Connected swipe-up gesture to open comments

## Decisions Made

- Used Animated.View with pointerEvents toggle instead of Modal component to prevent React Native from dismissing the sheet during navigation
- Added backdropOpacity animated value for smooth fade in/out separate from sheet translateY
- Swipe-up threshold set to -50px displacement or -0.5 velocity for natural feel

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Fixed gesture conflict between comment scrolling and swipe-to-dismiss**

- **Found during:** UAT verification
- **Issue:** Scrolling up in comments FlatList triggered swipe-to-dismiss gesture on parent view, closing the photo detail
- **Fix:** Added `commentsVisibleRef` to track when comments are open; panResponder now checks this and ignores gestures when comments sheet is visible
- **Files modified:** `src/hooks/usePhotoDetailModal.js`, `src/screens/PhotoDetailScreen.js`
- **Verification:** Can now scroll comments without closing photo view
- **Commit:** `99e0811`

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (bug)
**Impact on plan:** Required fix for usability. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness

- ISS-004 and ISS-005 both resolved
- Phase 33 complete (this was the only plan)
- Ready for Phase 34: Push Infrastructure
