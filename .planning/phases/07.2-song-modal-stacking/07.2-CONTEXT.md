# Phase 7.2: Song Modal Stacking Fix - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-28
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When selecting a song clip, the clip selection modal (at ~40% screen height, same as current) should slide up over the song search screen rather than replacing it. The search results stay visible behind, dimmed but present, creating a layered feel.

The key is that canceling clip selection brings you right back to the song search exactly where you left off — same scroll position, same search results. It should feel like one connected flow rather than two separate screens.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Not losing search position** - Cancel must bring you back to exactly where you were in search results
- Search scroll position preserved when returning from clip selection
- Connected flow feel between song search and clip selection

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- No visual redesign - just fix the navigation stacking
- Don't change how either modal looks
- Keep current clip selection height (~40% of screen)
- Keep current animations/transitions unless necessary for the fix

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Clip selection takes about 40% of screen height (same as current)
- Search results visible behind the clip selection modal
- Stacked layers visual approach

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This addresses UAT-007 from .planning/phases/07-profile-song/07-04-ISSUES.md. Current implementation replaces the song search modal when opening clip selection, so canceling loses the user's place in search results.
