**Testing device:** Physical iPhone (not simulator)
**Firebase environment:** Dev environment (familiar data, faster iteration)
**Starting state:** Clean slate — app deleted and reinstalled

**Onboarding flow (from codebase):**

1. PhoneInputScreen → phone number entry
2. VerificationScreen → 6-digit OTP code
3. ProfileSetupScreen → username, display name, profile photo
4. SelectsScreen → 3 initial content preferences
5. ContactsSyncScreen → optional contact sync
6. NotificationPermissionScreen → optional push permissions
7. MainTabs → Feed, Camera, Profile

**Empty states to verify:**

- Feed (no photos yet)
- Darkroom (no developing photos)
- Profile (no photos, no albums)
- Notifications (no notifications)
- Friends (no friends yet)
  </context>

  <action>Prepare iPhone for fresh install testing</action>
  <instructions>
    1. On your iPhone, delete the Flick app completely (long press → Remove App → Delete App)
    2. Install the latest dev build from TestFlight or EAS
    3. Launch the app
    4. Confirm you see the PhoneInputScreen (not logged in)

  <how-to-verify>
    **Step 1: Phone Authentication**
    1. Enter your phone number in international format (e.g., +1 234 567 8900)
    2. Tap "Send Code"
    3. Verify SMS arrives within 30 seconds
    4. Enter the 6-digit code
    5. Confirm navigation to ProfileSetupScreen

    **Expected:**
    - Phone input accepts valid format, shows error for invalid
    - "Send Code" button shows loading state while sending
    - SMS arrives promptly
    - Code input auto-focuses, accepts 6 digits
    - Invalid code shows error, valid code proceeds

    **Step 2: Profile Setup**
    1. Enter username (try: test[random4digits])
    2. Enter display name (your name)
    3. Tap "Choose Photo" → select from library
    4. Tap "Continue"
    5. Confirm navigation to SelectsScreen

    **Expected:**
    - Username validation (alphanumeric + underscore only)
    - Display name required (min 1 char)
    - Photo picker works, shows preview after selection
    - "Continue" disabled until all fields valid
    - Silkscreen font used for phone input and profile fields

    **Step 3: Selects (Content Preferences)**
    1. Tap 3 different preference cards
    2. Confirm selected cards show visual feedback
    3. Tap "Continue"
    4. Confirm navigation to ContactsSyncScreen

    **Expected:**
    - Must select exactly 3 before "Continue" enables
    - Selected state visually distinct
    - Tapping selected card deselects it

    **Step 4: Contacts Sync (Optional)**
    1. Tap "Skip for Now"
    2. Confirm navigation to NotificationPermissionScreen

    **Expected:**
    - Skip option immediately available
    - No permission prompt shown

    **Step 5: Notification Permission (Optional)**
    1. Tap "Skip for Now"
    2. Confirm navigation to MainTabs (Feed screen)

    **Expected:**
    - Skip option immediately available
    - Feed screen shows empty state UI

    **Step 6: Empty State Verification**
    1. Confirm Feed shows empty state message/illustration
    2. Tap Camera tab → confirm camera view appears
    3. Tap Profile tab → confirm profile screen with 0 photos, 0 albums
    4. Tap top-right bell icon → confirm Notifications empty state
    5. In Profile, tap Friends → confirm empty friends list
    6. In Camera, check Darkroom (swipe down or tap icon) → confirm empty darkroom

    **Expected:**
    - All empty states have clear messaging (not broken UI)
    - No crashes or loading spinners stuck forever
    - Navigation works across all tabs
