# Phase 36: Photo Notification Events - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-06
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When someone finishes their darkroom triage and posts photos to their story, their friends should get notified — "Alex just journaled some snaps." It's an invitation to come see what they captured, not a demand for attention.

When you're tagged in a photo, you get a subtle heads-up. The notification should feel informative rather than shouty — a gentle "you're in this moment" rather than screaming for attention. To keep it feeling human and not robotic, there should be 4-5+ varied notification templates so the same message doesn't repeat endlessly.

If someone tags you in multiple photos in the same session, it groups into one notification ("Alex tagged you in 3 photos") instead of spamming your phone.

Both types of notifications matter equally — tagged and story notifications are core to the photo-sharing experience.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Varied tag templates** — 4-5+ different wordings so notifications feel human, not robotic
- **Darkroom trigger timing** — Story notifications fire immediately when someone completes triage, not on each individual post
- **Deep linking** — Tapping a notification takes you exactly where you need to go:
  - Tagged notification → Opens the photo within that person's story (can swipe to see more)
  - Story notification → Opens that user's story view on their last unviewed story

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- Notification settings UI (toggle on/off) — that's Phase 38
- Rich media previews (photo thumbnails in notifications) — keep notifications simple
- Priority/hierarchy between notification types — all notifications treated equally

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Grouped notifications for batch tags ("Alex tagged you in 3 photos")
- Immediate delivery — no artificial delays after darkroom completion
- Story notifications triggered by darkroom triage completion, not individual story posts
- Template variety is key to the subtle/informative vibe
