### UAT-001: @react-native-firebase/app package.json exports warnings persist

**Discovered:** 2026-01-21
**Phase/Plan:** 16.3-01
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** Firebase warning elimination
**Description:** The @react-native-firebase/app package produces warnings about invalid package.json exports configuration. The warnings state that files in `dist/module/internal/` don't exist. This is an upstream package issue, not a code issue in our app.
**Expected:** Zero Firebase-related warnings on app startup
**Actual:** Multiple warnings appear:
```
WARN  The package ...\@react-native-firebase\app contains an invalid package.json configuration.
Reason: The resolution for "...\lib\internal\nativeModule" defined in "exports" is
...\dist\module\internal\nativeModule, however this file does not exist.
```
**Repro:**
1. Run `npx expo start`
2. Launch app on device
3. Observe warnings in terminal

**Note:** This is NOT the deprecated namespaced API warning that Phase 16.3 targeted. The namespaced API migration was successful - all code now uses modular imports. This warning is a bug in the @react-native-firebase package itself.

**Potential fixes:**
- Update @react-native-firebase packages to newer version
- Check if there's a known issue/fix in react-native-firebase GitHub
- May require waiting for upstream fix from package maintainers
