# Phase 13: UI/UX Overhaul - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-20
**Status:** Ready for research

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A comprehensive UI/UX overhaul across the entire app — camera/capture flow, feed/social experience, and overall visual polish. The goal is to make the app feel like a real, finished product before worrying about production deployment.

The app should feel clean and minimal — simple, fast, no clutter. Photos are the focus. Everything else gets out of the way.

Design language should match the real Lapse app. This is a clone, so it should look and feel like Lapse.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Visual consistency** — Colors, spacing, typography all feeling cohesive and intentional across every screen
- This is what separates a prototype from a real app. Every pixel should feel deliberate.

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- No new features — just polish what exists
- No backend changes — keep all services/data as-is, only touch UI
- No production deployment — EAS builds, TestFlight, app store stuff comes in a later phase

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Match the real Lapse app's design language
- Clean and minimal aesthetic
- Touch all three areas: camera/capture, feed/social, overall look & feel

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This phase is replacing what was originally "Production Build & Branding" in the roadmap. The user wants to nail the UX before going to TestFlight — get it functioning exactly how they envision first.

Production deployment (EAS builds, TestFlight) will be pushed to Phase 14.
