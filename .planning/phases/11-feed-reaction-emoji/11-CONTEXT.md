# Phase 11: Feed Reaction Emoji Enhancements - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-29
**Status:** Ready for planning

## How This Should Work

Each photo in the feed shows a fresh set of reaction emojis — not the same boring options every time. The emoji selection rotates through different categories (faces, animals, objects, etc.) so there's always variety and range. Swiping to a new photo means seeing different emoji options, keeping the experience fun and surprising.

At the end of the compact emoji row (5-6 emojis), there's an "Add your own" button with equal visual presence to the other emojis. Tapping it opens the native iOS emoji keyboard. When you select a custom emoji, it replaces the add button position in the picker — you see your chosen emoji in the row, then tap it to actually react. This preview step lets you see what you're about to send before committing.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Curated emoji variety** — Each photo shows a different, thoughtfully rotated set of emojis. Not random chaos, but intentional variety across categories so you always have range.
- **Custom emoji picker** — The ability to pick any emoji you want, making reactions feel personal. Native system keyboard keeps it simple and familiar.

Both are equally important — the variety keeps things fresh, and the custom option ensures you're never stuck without the perfect reaction.

## What's Out of Scope

- Animated or sticker emojis — iOS standard emojis only, no GIFs or motion
- Saved favorites — No remembering user's preferred emojis across sessions; fresh selection each time
- Reaction analytics — Not tracking which emojis are popular or used most

## Specific Ideas

- 5-6 emoji slots plus the add-your-own button (compact, fits comfortably)
- Add button has equal visual presence to emoji options (same size, not subtle)
- Native iOS emoji keyboard for custom selection (not a custom picker)
- Custom emoji replaces add button position in row, then tap to react (preview before commit)
- Categories to rotate through: faces/expressions, animals, objects, symbols, food, etc.

## Additional Context

The goal is making reactions feel fun and personal rather than a fixed, predictable set of options. The curated rotation prevents staleness while the custom picker ensures users always have the option they want.
