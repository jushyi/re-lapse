# Phase 31: Settings Section Headers - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-05
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Simple text headers that divide the Settings page into logical categories. When users open Settings, they should see clean section headers like "Account", "Privacy", "Support" that group related items together.

The headers are static text dividers — no interactive behavior, no collapse/expand. Just clear visual organization that helps users find what they're looking for quickly.

Standard app categories:

- **Account** — profile editing, account management
- **Privacy** — blocked users, privacy controls
- **Support** — help link, app version

</vision>

<essential>
## What Must Be Nailed

- **Clear visual organization** — Users should instantly see what category they're in when scrolling through Settings
- **Match existing aesthetic** — Headers must feel native to the app's dark theme style, not bolted on

Both matter equally. The headers should improve findability while feeling like they've always been there.

## What's Out of Scope

- No collapsible sections — headers are static, always visible
- No new settings items — just organizing existing items into sections
- No interactive header behavior — purely visual organization

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard approaches that match the app's existing dark theme patterns.

## Additional Context

This is a polish phase for the milestone. Settings currently has all items in a flat list; section headers will improve scannability and match common iOS/Android settings patterns.
