## Open Issues

### UAT-001: Comments on profiles don't navigate properly

**Discovered:** 2026-02-02
**Phase/Plan:** 15.2-01
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Modal state preservation - comment avatar navigation
**Description:** Clicking comments on profiles doesn't work - doesn't navigate properly
**Expected:** Tapping avatar in comments should navigate to that user's profile
**Actual:** Navigation doesn't work correctly
**Repro:**

1. Open a photo modal
2. Open comments
3. Tap on a commenter's avatar
4. Navigation fails or behaves unexpectedly

### UAT-002: Feed flashes before modal restoration on back navigation

**Discovered:** 2026-02-02
**Phase/Plan:** 15.2-01
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Modal state preservation - back navigation
**Description:** Weird behavior when navigating back to saved state - feed flashes for a second before modal pops up. Looks ugly.
**Expected:** Smooth transition directly back to the open modal without seeing feed
**Actual:** Feed is visible briefly before modal restoration occurs
**Repro:**

1. Open a story/photo modal
2. Tap avatar to view profile (profile peek)
3. Press back
4. See feed flash briefly before modal appears

### UAT-003: Architecture - Layered profile instead of save/restore

**Discovered:** 2026-02-02
**Phase/Plan:** 15.2-01
**Severity:** Major (Architecture change)
**Feature:** Modal state preservation approach
**Description:** User suggests that instead of saving state and restoring it, the profile should be layered ABOVE the current screen. On return, it just goes back to the layer underneath - no save/restore needed.
**Expected:** Profile peek as overlay that slides away to reveal unchanged state underneath
**Actual:** Current implementation saves state, closes modal, navigates, then restores on back
**Notes:** This would simplify the architecture and eliminate flash issues entirely. Consider using a modal presentation or stack with transparent background for profile peek.

### UAT-004: Feed refreshes on every navigation (unrelated to modal preservation)

**Discovered:** 2026-02-02
**Phase/Plan:** 15.2-01
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Feed screen behavior
**Description:** Feed refreshes every time you navigate to it, causing loading screen to show continuously. Should only refresh on pull down and when first launching the app.
**Expected:** Feed data persists during navigation, only refreshes on: 1) Pull-to-refresh, 2) App launch
**Actual:** Feed shows loading indicator and fetches data every time screen comes into focus
**Repro:**

1. Open app, let feed load
2. Navigate away (to profile, camera, etc.)
3. Navigate back to feed
4. See loading indicator and full refresh
