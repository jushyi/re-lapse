# Phase 15.2: Modal State Preservation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When tapping any avatar throughout the app - in story viewer, feed photos, comments sheets, or feed comments - navigating to that user's profile should feel like a quick peek. The profile opens, you can explore it, and when you press back, you're right back where you were.

The return should be seamless. Same scroll position, same photo showing in the viewer, same comment visible - everything exactly as you left it. It shouldn't feel like a disruptive navigation that loses your place; it should feel like the profile was just layered on top and you're resuming where you paused.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Exact state preservation** - Return to the precise state: scroll position, which photo was showing, comments visible, everything preserved
- **All avatar flows** - This applies everywhere avatars are tappable: story viewer, feed photos, comments sheets, and comments on feed items
- **Seamless feel** - The transition back should be instant and natural, not a jarring navigation or reload

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- **Profile-to-profile chains** - If you navigate from one profile to another (via their albums, friends list, etc.), normal back navigation is fine - no special preservation needed
- **Deep linking** - External links opening profiles don't need special return handling
- **New navigation patterns** - This is about fixing the existing avatar → profile → back flow, not adding new ways to view profiles

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

No specific app references - open to standard approaches that achieve the seamless return feel. The key is that users shouldn't lose their place when curiosity leads them to tap on someone's avatar.

## Additional Context

This enhancement came from 15-03 UAT testing. The current behavior where back navigation goes to the feed with a refresh feels disconnected - users lose their context and have to navigate back to where they were manually.

The scope expanded beyond just story/comment modals to include all avatar taps throughout the app, including feed items and their comments.
