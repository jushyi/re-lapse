<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update README.md</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Update README.md with the following structure (in this order):
1. Title and one-line description
2. What It Is section - 2-3 sentences explaining the Lapse clone concept (friends-only, darkroom reveals, authentic moments)
3. Tech Stack section - bullet list of core technologies (React Native, Expo, Firebase services)
4. Getting Started section with:
   - Prerequisites (Node.js, Expo CLI, Firebase project)
   - Installation steps (clone, install deps, configure Firebase)
   - Running the app (npx expo start)
5. Project Structure section - brief overview pointing to key directories

Keep it minimal and practical. Match the concise tone of CLAUDE.md. Do NOT add emojis anywhere. Do NOT include badges, screenshots, or license sections.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create CONTRIBUTING.md</name>
  <files>CONTRIBUTING.md</files>
  <action>
Create CONTRIBUTING.md with the following sections:
1. Development Setup - link to README for basic setup
2. Code Style section covering:
   - File naming (PascalCase components, camelCase services)
   - Function naming (camelCase, handle prefix for event handlers)
   - Import organization order
3. Patterns section covering:
   - Service return pattern ({ success, error } objects)
   - Error handling (try/catch with logger)
   - Logging requirements (use logger utility, not console.log)
   - Component structure (functional only, hooks for state)
4. Commit Messages section - format: type(scope): description
5. Before Submitting section - run lint, run tests, no console.log

Base content on .planning/codebase/CONVENTIONS.md. Keep it practical for collaborators (friends/colleagues), not formal open-source. Do NOT include code of conduct, issue templates, or PR guidelines. Do NOT use emojis.
