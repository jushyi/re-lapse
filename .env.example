# Lapse Clone Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values
#
# IMPORTANT: This file is primarily documentation. See notes below.

# ============================================
# FIREBASE (React Native Firebase)
# ============================================
# Firebase configuration is handled via NATIVE CONFIG FILES, not environment variables:
#
# - iOS: GoogleService-Info.plist (download from Firebase Console)
# - Android: google-services.json (download from Firebase Console)
#
# These files are .gitignored and must be obtained from Firebase Console:
# 1. Go to Firebase Console > Project Settings
# 2. Select your iOS/Android app
# 3. Download the config file
# 4. Place in repository root (iOS) or android/app (Android)
#
# Do NOT put Firebase API keys in this file - they belong in the platform-specific
# config files which are .gitignored for security.

# ============================================
# EAS BUILD (Managed Expo Builds)
# ============================================
# For production/preview builds, Firebase config is injected via EAS Secrets.
# Set these using: eas secret:create --scope project --name SECRET_NAME
#
# GOOGLE_SERVICES_PLIST - Base64 encoded GoogleService-Info.plist content
#   Usage: Automatically injected during EAS Build via app.config.js
#   Set via: eas secret:create --scope project --name GOOGLE_SERVICES_PLIST
#
# GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON - Path to google-services.json (if Android is added)
#   Usage: Would be injected for Android builds
#   Set via: eas secret:create --scope project --name GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON

# ============================================
# OPTIONAL: Cloud Functions Local Emulator
# ============================================
# Set to 'true' when running local Firebase emulator for function testing.
# This is typically not needed for normal development.
#
# FUNCTIONS_EMULATOR=false

# ============================================
# OPTIONAL: Development Overrides
# ============================================
# These are not currently used but documented for future extensibility.
#
# DEBUG_MODE=false
# API_TIMEOUT=30000
